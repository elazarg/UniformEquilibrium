"""Exact exclusion of constant pair-support periodic profiles.

The table is the block-pair quitting game with
``r_0({0})=-2+11/100``.  Fix a pair ``{j,k}`` and suppose that precisely j
and k use hazards strictly between zero and one at every phase of a finite
periodic profile.

Put ``z_i=(V_i-q_i)/2``, where ``q_i`` is player i's solo payoff.  Active
indifference at a pair-support phase gives

    z_j^+ = a_jk * odds(x_k),
    z_j   = b_jk * x_k,

where

    a_jk = (r_j({j,k})-r_j({k}))/2,
    b_jk = (r_j({j,k})-q_j)/2.

When ``a_jk`` is nonzero, eliminating ``x_k`` yields the scalar predecessor
map

    z_j = f_jk(z_j^+) = b_jk*z_j^+/(a_jk+z_j^+).

For supports 3={0,1} and 9={0,3}, both coordinate maps are strictly
increasing on their valid odds rays.  A monotone self-map of a line has no
nonconstant finite periodic orbit, so both active-coordinate sequences are
constant; the hazards are then constant too.  The imported exact stationary
pair-support fences exclude the resulting roots.

For supports 5, 6, 10, and 12, one displayed active coordinate is identically
zero on one side of every phase and has a strict sign on the other side.
Consecutive use of that support is therefore impossible before any inactive
inequality is considered.

Hazard-zero phases reduce to a smaller support.  Hazard-one phases belong to
the separately certified sure-quitter boundary.  This checker covers only a
constant two-player support; transitions between different supports remain
open.
