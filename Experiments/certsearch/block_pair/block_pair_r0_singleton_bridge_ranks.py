"""Exact singleton-bridge reductions for support-6 excursions.

This checker closes two unbounded finite-run families in the perturbed
block-pair quitting game.

First, consider

    support {2 or 6} -> (a nonempty finite support-1 block) -> support 2.

Player 1's active equality at either entering support requires successor
value 2.  Player 1 is active at the final support 2, so its value there is
also 2.  During the support-1 block, absorption gives player 1 payoff 8.  If
H is the block's aggregate absorption probability, its value at entry is
therefore ``8H+2(1-H)=2+6H>2``.  The support transition is impossible,
independently of inactive inequalities.  This removes both simple skeletons
beginning ``6,1,2``, every bare ``2,1+,2`` backtrack, and every version with
repeated support-1 phases.

Second, consider

    support 6 -> (a finite support-2 block) -> support 9+ -> support 6,

where the final support-6 phase is endpoint-credible in the sense of
``block_pair_r0_support9_endpoint_rank.py``.  Player 2 receives zero when the
singleton player 1 quits.  If H is the block absorption probability and x is
the effective incoming hazard defined by the support-9 current value, the
Bellman equality is

    (1-H) * (2+6x/(1-x)) = 2+6a/(1-a).

Exact elimination gives

    x-a = H(1-a)(2a+1) / (3-2H(1-a)) >= 0.

The arbitrary support-9-run lemma consumes only that effective incoming
hazard and the fact that player 1's value at the first support 9 is 2.  It
gives ``A>x`` even when H=0, hence ``A>a``.  This closes the skeleton
``6,2,9,6`` with arbitrary positive support-2 and support-9 block lengths,
without prescribing what follows the final 6.

There is also a complete singleton-word return rank.  In every nonempty
finite excursion

    support 6 -> word over {support 1, support 2} -> support 6,

player 2 receives zero at either possible singleton absorption.  Collapsing
the whole word to its survival S gives

    S*(2+4A) = 2+6a/(1-a),

and an exact positive factorization forces ``A>a``.  This includes arbitrary
owner changes and closes the simple skeleton ``6,2,1,6``.

Scope: these are finite strict-run reductions inside the five-mask core.
Changing singleton owners in another order, support-3 excursions,
nonperiodic boundary convergence, and zero-hazard flow are not claimed.
