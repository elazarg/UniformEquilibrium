# Uniform-equilibrium research experiments

This directory is deliberately isolated from the production theorem graph.
Its programs are small executable falsifiers, finite-model prototypes, or
isolated Lean proof probes for research ideas. Lean probes may import active
proof modules, but production modules never import this directory. A curated
set of active Lean probes is imported by `Experiments.lean` and compiled by
the default `ActiveExperiments` target. A successful finite run is evidence
only for its stated bounded claim; a successful Lean probe checks the theorem
it declares without promoting that theorem into the production import graph.

The former source repository collected the signal-processing interpretation in
`ideas/wild/README.md`. That is a provenance locator, not a live path; see
[`../../TRANSITION.md`](../../TRANSITION.md). New derivations follow the
Discussion → Issue → PR workflow in [`../../docs/PIPELINE.md`](../../docs/PIPELINE.md).

## Directory lifecycle

- The top-level registered programs and Lean probes form the reproducible base
  suite listed below; keep their paths stable because `run_all.py` and
  `RESULTS.md` refer to them directly.
- [`quitting_repair_cegis/`](../quitting_repair_cegis/) is the tracked exact-rational
  repair search package.
- `certsearch/` contains certificate-guided searches; its `block_pair/`
  subdirectory contains the larger historical block-pair campaign.
- `counterexample_pairwise_consistency/` contains the Q172 pair/triple
  consistency campaign and its exact witnesses.
- `quitting/` and `tools/` contain useful unregistered probes routed out of
  scratch space.
- `archive/integrated/` retains experiment sources already consumed by
  production Lean; `archive/rejected/` retains explicit negative or incomplete
  probes. Neither archive is an active implementation queue.

Python caches, `*.olean`, screenshots, and logs are generated products rather
than experiments and should not be stored here.

An active Lean probe must be source-reproducible: force-add its source and all
of its `Experiments.*` dependencies, then import its top-level module from
`Experiments.lean`. The repository audit rejects missing or untracked sources,
production imports of experiments, and tracked probes outside that curated
root. Remove an abandoned probe from `Experiments.lean`; do not rely on a
stale local `.olean` to keep it compiling.

Proposed adversarial searches that have not yet been implemented are specified
in [`PROPOSALS.md`](PROPOSALS.md). Each proposal records its exact finite
protocol and the proof required before any result can be promoted beyond
bounded experimental evidence.

Run the registered base suite with:

```powershell
python Experiments/run_all.py
```

The suite uses only the Python standard library. Each experiment prints a
machine-readable JSON summary and contains internal assertions for the stated
finite claims. Exact external data is not itself a Lean proof: promotion
requires constructing the named production certificate.

| E36 | [`quitting_repair_cegis/`](../quitting_repair_cegis/) | Which exact rational cutoff, stationary, or periodic profiles repair a finite quitting table, and which proposed fixed exploitability gaps are refuted within a recorded finite grammar? |

The output records `status`, the exact checks performed, and limitations. A
negative or inconclusive result is retained: these scripts are intended to kill
attractive but false interfaces early.
