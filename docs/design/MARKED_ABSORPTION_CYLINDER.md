# Marked absorption cylinder and generalized traces

Design record for the boundary object of `MATH-P0-1` / `LEAN-P1-4`: the finite
encoding of a calibrated exact-`D` block, and the limit space it sits densely
inside.

Evidence discipline: `L` is production Lean; `M` is audited mathematics, not
formalized; `O` is an open obligation.

`L` The source-retaining finite realization layer is
`UniformEquilibrium/Quitting/AbsorptionPath/RealizedMarkedAbsorptionCylinder.lean`.
It bounds every prefix by the realized block exit and proves exact coalition-
mass accounting, survival and holonomy pins, free terminal-continuation
evaluation, and same-source concatenation.  It deliberately retains the
source block, literal length, and chronology.  It is the finite semantic
adapter used to validate formulas, **not** the source-forgetting cylinder
specified below.

`L` The first genuinely source-forgetting primitive is
`UniformEquilibrium/Quitting/AbsorptionPath/MarkedObstacleRecord.lean`.  Its
encoder discards the source word, horizon, and literal offset after one stage,
while retaining the current product root, pre/post vector factors, full and
player-deleted survival, local Bellman data, continuation, and obstacle
ordinate.  The encoder image satisfies the vector, full-product,
deleted-product, survival-update, and Bellman recurrences.  This is one marked
chronological record, not yet the completed graph or a block cylinder.

## 1. Notation for a finite block

Let `ι` be the finite player set and `𝒥` the nonempty subsets of `ι`, with
reward `r : 𝒥 → Payoff ι`. A block of length `m` is a family of live product
roots `x_t : ι → PMF Bool`, `t < m`, from one actual common zero-boundary
Nash–Bellman chain. For a single root `x`:

| Quantity | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| continue mass | `c(x) = ∏_i x_i(false)` |
| absorption into `J ∈ 𝒥` | `a(x)(J) = ∏_{i∈J} x_i(true) · ∏_{i∉J} x_i(false)` |
| opponent-only continue mass | `c_{-i}(x) = ∏_{j≠i} x_j(false)` |

so `Σ_{J∈𝒥} a(x)(J) = 1 - c(x)`. The two survival products are

\[
 S(t)=\prod_{u<t}c(x_u),
 \qquad
 S_{-i}(t)=\prod_{u<t}c_{-i}(x_u),
\]

with accumulated mass `τ(t) = 1 - S(t)`.

## 2. The cylinder carries `|ι|+1` clocks

`L` The landed holonomy coordinates already separate two survival factors: the
prescribed slope is full survival `P = S(m)`, while the unilateral max-affine
slope is opponent-only survival `χ_i = S_{-i}(m)`.

`M` This is not presentational duplication. Player `i`'s quit-at-`t` value is

\[
 Q_i(t)=S_{-i}(t)\cdot
 \sum_{J\subseteq\iota\setminus\{i\}}
 \Bigl[\textstyle\prod_{j\in J}x_{t,j}(\mathrm{true})
       \prod_{j\notin J\cup\{i\}}x_{t,j}(\mathrm{false})\Bigr]
 \, r_i\bigl(J\cup\{i\}\bigr),
\]

because a deviator quitting at `t` has obeyed only up to `t`, so its weight is
opponent-only survival. Total mass advances whenever player `i` alone quits,
while `S_{-i}` does not move: the clocks differ by exactly `i`'s own
contribution, and `S_{-i}` is not recoverable from the aggregate absorption
path. Collapsing stages destroys the per-stage product structure relating them.

The playerwise clocks are therefore load-bearing for **every** player's cap,
not only for bookkeeping the debt owner.

**Carrier.** The absorption and clock coordinates are paths in the mass
parameter `τ ∈ [0, 1 - s_exit]`, not block totals and not endpoint scalars.
Build the path by setting it at the stage masses `τ(t)` to
`Σ_{u<t} S(u) a(x_u)(J)`, then extending affinely on each `[τ(t), τ(t+1)]`,
splitting the increment across coalitions in proportion to `a(x_t)(·)`. This
makes `τ` an honest arclength, so `Σ_J` of the path is exactly `τ` and the path
is `1`-Lipschitz in `ℓ¹` — the bound the compactness argument consumes.
Snapping `τ` to the nearest completed stage does **not** satisfy the identity:
between stage masses the snapped value is a jump value.

`τ` is mass, not calendar time, so paths do not reintroduce the length fence. A
finite list of absorption atoms is rejected for the opposite reason: its atom
count is a natural-number coordinate that diverges exactly as calendar length
does, re-importing the `14d75ff` obstruction.

Every mass and survival coordinate is bounded in `[0,1]`: in particular
`0 ≤ s_exit ≤ 1` and `0 ≤ χ_i ≤ 1` are both required as fields. The upper
bounds are not decoration — without `s_exit ≤ 1` the domain `[0, 1 - s_exit]`
can be empty and the "recorded points lie in the mass domain" obligations are
unprovable, in the encoding and again in every composition.

**Endpoint scalars are stored and pinned, not derived.** Keep `s_exit`, `χ_i`,
and the cap as fields, each carrying a hypothesis pinning it to its path. `ℝ`'s
order is classical and not kernel-reducible, so a cap defined by `sSup` and a
defect defined by a sum over a *spliced* path both fail to reduce
definitionally, and `forgetful_compose` stops being `rfl`. That `rfl` is the
only line machine-checking the encoding against the landed holonomy law; it is
worth more than eliminating five fields.

## 3. The obstacle is not a function of mass

`M` The stopping obstacle does **not** descend to accumulated mass, and neither
do the deleted clocks after full absorption.

The tempting argument — a stretch with no mass advance has `c(x_u) = 1`, so all
coordinates continue, so the bracket is `r_i({i})` and `Q_i` is constant — is
true but irrelevant. `τ(t)` is the mass absorbed **strictly before** `t`, so
`τ(t) = τ(t')` constrains the preceding rows and says nothing about the row the
obstacle reads at `t'`. That row is unconstrained.

Minimal counterexample, `I = {1,2}`, `i = 1`, `r_1({1}) = 0`,
`r_1({1,2}) = 1`, so `Q_1(p,t) = S_{-1}(t)·p_{t,2}`:

```
p_0 = (0,0),  p_1 = (0,1)
τ(0) = τ(1) = 0        (row 0 absorbs nothing)
Q_1(p,0) = 0,  Q_1(p,1) = 1
```

Same accumulated mass, different obstacle. The missing datum is the current
row. The failure is not confined to zero rows; the universal all-scheme descent
property holds only in the degenerate case `r_i(K) = 0` for every `K ∋ i`.
Separately, after total mass reaches `1` a deleted clock can still change, and
under uniform convergence the family of deleted clocks is not compact — it can
converge pointwise to a terminal jump.

**Consequence.** The obstacle and clock coordinates are completed graphs, not
functions.  The clock graph may live over the vector-factor chronology, but a
mass-only obstacle hypograph is insufficient:

```
G_i = completed chronological graph of  t ↦ (τ(t), S_{-i}(t))
O_i = joint completed graph of the stage obstacle record, carrying
      its pre/post cumulative points, current root/continuation mark,
      and obstacle ordinate
H_i^cap = optional hypograph/envelope derived from O_i for cap evaluation
```

A hypograph over `τ` alone collapses all records on a repeated-mass fibre to
their upper envelope.  It retains the cap but loses lower obstacle values,
multiplicity, order, and the stage/profile mark.  Thus it cannot satisfy the
requirement to retain zero-mass chronology.  `O_i` must instead live over a
compact **marked chronological base**; the exact smallest base remains part of
the decoder design.

For a nonempty compact obstacle set in a fixed compact marked base, the cap is
the maximum of a continuous ordinate and is therefore continuous in Hausdorff
distance.  A maximizing sequence retains a convergent maximizing subsequence,
but no continuous choice of maximizer is automatic.  The argmax correspondence
has a closed graph; a selected witness must be carried explicitly if the
decoder needs one continuously.  Ambient graph concatenation is continuous
once mark transport is defined, but closure of the realized complementary
carrier under concatenation—and exact finite seam pullback—remain separate
theorems.  The uniform-clock topology delivers none of these conclusions.

## 4. Exit port and Never are different types

`M` For a finite block the defect `s_exit = S(m)` is survival to the exit port,
transported into the successor and evaluated at *its* continuation. Genuine
`Never` mass arises only for a completed infinite path, as the limit of
`s_exit` along a concatenation chain.

These are separated at the level of types:

- `MarkedAbsorptionCylinder` — finite. Subprobability with defect `s_exit`. No
  `Never` field.
- `MarkedAbsorptionPath` — completed. A `Never` atom `ν_∞`, no exit port.

A single type with an "is-final" flag is rejected: it reinstates the
wrong-composition risk at every concatenation lemma. Declaring a finite block's
remainder to be `Never` gives the wrong payoff and the wrong deviation values.

## 5. The mark is an independent coordinate

`L` The calibrated anchor separates preterminal opponent survival from the
final marked atom.

`M` The transported packet mass is `preterminalSurvival × terminalMass`, and
this may tend to zero along a family whose conditional kernel `κ_*` and
advantage stay bounded away from zero. So `κ_*` is not a continuous function of
the absorption path and cannot be reconstructed from it — nor from the other
enriched coordinates. It enters as an independent pointed coordinate: the raw
conditional kernel at the marked root, the owner `i_*`, the marked action
profile and quitter set `T_*`, and the advantage scalar, each stored separately
from the transported mass.

`(i_*, J_*)` must be globally fixed, or else carried as a finite discrete
coordinate. Allowing them to vary silently leaves the mark-composition law
undefined.

## 6. Anchors make splice legality closed

`M` Entry and exit anchors are exact-`D` root data valued in a compact space.
Concatenation is legal exactly when `e_out(z) = e_in(z')` — an equality in a
Hausdorff space, hence a **closed** condition whenever anchors are retained as
fields. This is why anchors are coordinates rather than side conditions: it
converts admissibility, which the scalar projection forgets, into a relation
surviving limits. Anchor-free spliceability is not even well-defined.

## 7. What the cylinder forgets

| Dropped | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| literal block length `m` | `L`: every compact subset of `ℕ × X` has bounded length, so retaining literal length forecloses the compactification the route exists to obtain. |
| the complete source word | It is what makes the fixed-cutoff lift compact at each cutoff and what cannot survive an escaping middle. |

The encoding map is intentionally non-injective. Proving the retained data
still determines all semantics is the content of P0-A.

## 8. The finite-encoding obligations

`O` For every calibrated exact-`D` block, prove:

1. **Payoff.** The cylinder's prescribed value equals the block's literal
   finite policy value, slope `P = s_exit`.
2. **Obstacle.** `O_i` equals the joint marked completed graph of the block's
   literal quit-at-`t` records, including repeated-mass stages; its derived cap
   equals the landed max-affine cap coordinate, slope `χ_i = S_{-i}(m)`.
   If a pointed cap hypograph is also stored, prove its incidence and maximizing
   equations rather than assuming a continuous argmax selection.
3. **Clocks.** `G_i` and the absorption path agree with `S(·)`, `S_{-i}(·)`.
4. **Packet.** `preterminalSurvival`, `terminalMass`, `κ_*`, `T_*`, advantage
   agree with the calibrated anchor, the two mass factors kept separate.
5. **Debt.** Retained entry debt equals the block's dynamic debt at entry.
6. **Anchors.** `e_in`, `e_out` are the block's exact-`D` endpoints.
7. **Concatenation.** The cylinder of a concatenation equals the composition of
   cylinders, associatively, agreeing with the landed `(B,P)`/`(A,T,χ)` laws
   under the forgetful map.

Item 7 subsumes the test that matters most: the forgetful map to holonomy
coordinates must be a homomorphism. If it is not, the encoding is wrong
independently of any topology.

The realized source adapter proves the row-level coalition-mass telescope,
arbitrary-terminal prescribed and unilateral evaluation, endpoint clocks, and
the existing holonomy/clock laws for adjacent cuts of one calibrated source.
The source-forgetting obstacle-record encoder proves the corresponding
one-stage factor, clock, Bellman, and obstacle equations.  Together they still
do **not** discharge the list above: there is no source-forgetting block path or
marked obstacle graph, and same-source concatenation is not a composition law
for semantic cylinders.  The distinction is enforced by the exported type name
`RealizedMarkedAbsorptionCylinder`; the name `MarkedAbsorptionCylinder` remains
available for the eventual target type.

## 9. The limit space

`M` The finite realizable set is **not closed**. Finite `μ`-paths are finitely
piecewise affine while limits can be genuinely nonlinear. This is not a
missing-coordinate problem:

> No additional coordinate valued in a sequentially compact space can make the
> finite realizable image closed while the projection back to the enriched
> coordinates stays continuous.

So there is no "smallest compact coordinate that closes it". The alternatives
are a noncompact complexity coordinate, or admitting infinite/diffuse
generalized objects.

`M` The anchored completed vector-factor chain ambient space is compact in the
Hausdorff topology.  Under the straight-chord convention and with the terminal
vector fixed or stored, it continuously determines full/deleted survival and
the prescribed origin value.  Compact marked obstacle sets determine their
caps continuously.  These are the audited numerical core, not the full carrier.

`O` The target is the **joint semantic-graph closure** of generalized completed
chronological traces: vector-factor trace, coalition path, marked obstacle
graph, holonomy, anchors, debt, packet, and compact chronological provenance.
Finite blocks are dense by construction and continuous finite identities pass
to the closure.  Coordinates may be removed only after a theorem proves every
decoder observable and splice operation constant on their fibres.

Ambient concatenation extends continuously once anchors and a mark-transport
convention are retained.  Two additional facts do **not** follow from that:
the realized complementary closure must be proved stable under splice, and a
limit exact seam/self-seam must pull back to exactly composable finite
approximants under boundary-row flexibility.  The latter is the pullback a
surgery decoder needs and remains open.

## 10. Standing fences

- Do not pursue a compact added coordinate closing the finite realizable set.
  That shape is proved impossible.
- Do not state the obstacle or the deleted clocks as functions of `τ`.
- Do not claim a mass-only obstacle hypograph retains chronology; it retains
  only the fibrewise envelope and cap.
- A cylinder is a semantic encoding, not a repair. It supplies neither decoder.
- Do not infer exact finite seam or self-seam pullback from compactness,
  density, closed anchor equality, or ambient splice continuity.
- The published sure-terminal-jump endpoint defect is unrepaired; the
  restricted and augmented adapters remain the two options.
- Exact identities for attainable data do not make the attainable set closed.
