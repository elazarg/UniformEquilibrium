Theorem 1 gives every finite-state, finite-action, finite-signal POMDP a
uniform expected-average value for every initial distribution and, for each
\(\varepsilon>0\), one behavior strategy that is \(\varepsilon\)-optimal for
all sufficiently long horizons and all sufficiently patient discounts. The
general strategy need be neither pure nor stationary; the paper's example
also shows that exact Blackwell-optimal strategies need not exist.

Theorem 2.9 proves that every finite POMDP has deterministic finite-memory
\(\varepsilon\)-optimal strategies for its long-run average value. Remark 2.1
identifies that value with the asymptotic finite-horizon and uniform values.
Corollary 3.2 makes the promised-gap approximation problem recursively
enumerable but undecidable for general POMDPs, and Remark 3.3 rules out a
computable general memory bound. These general hardness conclusions do not
transfer merely from the value theorem. Q99 now supplies a separate internal
PFA embedding for exact threshold hardness in its product-filter controller
subclass; that embedding does not yet transfer the general no-memory-bound
statement for \(\varepsilon\)-optimal strategies.

Theorem 1(a) gives undecidability of strict and weak PFA emptiness at cutpoint
\(1/7\) with seven states, four positive doubly-stochastic input matrices,
and one accepting state. Q99's elementary PFA-to-private-controller gadget
therefore yields the audited small upper bound of two players, one public
state, nine opponent-memory states, five deviator actions, and two opponent
actions for strict-threshold hardness. Those game dimensions and the embedding
are repository derivations, not statements in Rote's paper, and are not
minimality claims.

Section 2 records that strict-cutpoint PFA emptiness is co-r.e.-complete and
that PFA value equality \(\operatorname{val}(A)=x\) is
\(\Pi^0_2\)-complete, even for \(x=1\); the paper attributes the latter
result to the authors' 2013 MFCS paper. This is the primary-source restatement
used in the Q99 audit. Combined with Q99's internal value-preserving embedding
and the direct finite-transducer quantifiers, it calibrates the exact Q99
arithmetic hierarchy; the combination is not itself an external theorem.

2.3 gives every finite multiplayer stochastic game a uniform autonomous
correlated-equilibrium payoff. The device can depend on the requested
accuracy and the general construction uses private current recommendations
and one-stage-delayed disclosure. Fresh contingent tables are independent
across dates. After a detected unilateral deviation, the ordinary coalition-
minmax punishment ignores the continuing device signals; the construction
does not use correlated punishment. Q100 isolates endogenous implementation
of the mediated target; this theorem does not supply an ordinary Nash profile
or reduce the problem to a public coin.

The peer-reviewed paper's Theorem 4.14 states that `FinNE` and `PureFinNE`
are undecidable even for 14-player simple stochastic multiplayer games
(SSMGs). Its proof is explicitly labelled **“Proof sketch”**: it reduces from
two-counter-machine halting, adds a clock counter and four monitor players,
and gives the halting/nonhalting memory dichotomy, but does not spell out
every gadget verification. The paper does **not** state the corresponding
`FinSPE` theorem; do not cite it for that strengthening.

`—` `[primary]`

The thesis's Theorem 4.13 states that `PureFinNE`, `PureFinSPE`, `FinNE`, and
`FinSPE` are undecidable even for 14-player SSMGs. The displayed proof is
again explicitly a **sketch**. What it does state is exactly the source
dichotomy used by the current Q98 answer: if the encoded two-counter machine
does not halt, every Nash equilibrium in which player 0 wins almost surely
needs infinite memory; if it halts, there is a pure finite-state
subgame-perfect equilibrium in which player 0 wins almost surely. The latter
direction refers back to the arguments for Theorem 4.10 rather than repeating
them. Record the theorem as a primary-source result, but keep the proof-sketch
qualification attached whenever it is used as a reduction premise.

This is the shorter precursor. Its finite-state construction is also only
sketched (the text leaves details to the reader) and should not be substituted
for the thesis's explicit `FinSPE` statement.

## Citation traps recorded during verification

1. Bewley–Kohlberg MOR **1**(3):197–208 ≠ MOR **1**(4):321–336.
2. Renault JEMS DOI is `/254`, not `/256`.
3. Vieille 2000 is **three** papers; I alone proves nothing.
4. Vieille is sole author; Solan did not co-author the two-player solution.
5. Venel–Ziliotto was retitled between arXiv and SIAM.
6. Renault's in-text "Mertens and Neyman (1982)" refers to the PNAS
   announcement, not a typo for 1981.
7. Theorem numbers for Renault (Thm 6.2, Cor 3.9, Thm 3.7, Thm 1.5, Cor 1.6,
   Thm 1.10, Prop 1.8) and Venel–Ziliotto (Thm 4) are **arXiv-version
   artifacts**; typeset versions were inaccessible.
8. Hansen–Ibsen-Jensen–Neyman have two distinct relevant papers (MOR 2023
   clock-and-a-bit; arXiv:2505.02623 limited public memory).
9. `MeasureTheory/Integral/RieszMarkovKakutani/` in mathlib is the *Riesz–
   Markov–Kakutani representation theorem*, **not** the Kakutani fixed-point
   theorem.
10. HTML renderings of arXiv bibliographies **hallucinate page numbers**. Use
    `pdftotext`.
11. Renault–Ziliotto 2020 is **two** papers (MOR and GEB), and their Sorin
    citation is wrong (see above).
12. Sorin's `E(∞)` is the **uniform** equilibrium payoff set, not a
    limiting-average one; his paper contains no Cesàro equilibrium concept.
    Sorin discounts with `λ ∈ (0,1]` and the patient limit at `λ → 0`.
