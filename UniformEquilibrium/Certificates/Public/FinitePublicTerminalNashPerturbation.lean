# Terminal perturbation robustness of the finite public-tree backward-Nash profile

The backward-induction Nash construction of
`FinitePublicTerminalNashSystem.lean` selects one
behavior profile from one terminal obstacle.  This file measures what happens
to that *already selected* profile when the terminal obstacle is replaced by a
uniformly close one.  Nothing is reselected: the profile stays the profile of
the original obstacle.

Write `σ` for `FinitePublicTerminalNashSystem.profile obstacle` and suppose
`|perturbed history who - obstacle history who| ≤ error` at every terminal
public history and for every player.  Then:

* the prescribed terminal expectation moves by at most `error`
  (`abs_expect_perturbed_sub_expect_obstacle_le`);
* every history-dependent unilateral behavior deviation gains at most
  `2 * error` against the perturbed obstacle
  (`expect_perturbed_deviation_le_expect_perturbed`);
* the same `2 * error` deviation bound holds at *every* node of the bounded
  public-history tree, not just at the root
  (`worstUnilateral_le_prescribed_add_two_error`).

The constant is depth free.  The middle step of the deviation estimate uses
the *exact* Nash property of `σ` for `obstacle`, so no per-level error
accumulates; the tree depth `fuel` never enters the bound.

## Sharpness

`TerminalPerturbationSharpness.exists_gain_eq` exhibits, for every accuracy
`error ≥ 0` and every margin `slack > 0`, a one-stage one-player game and a
pair of terminal payoff systems at uniform distance `error` for which one
behavior deviation gains *exactly* `2 * error - slack` against the perturbed
system.  Letting `slack` tend to zero shows the constant `2` cannot be
lowered; `TerminalPerturbationSharpness.exists_gain_gt_error` records the
weaker but immediate consequence that `error` alone never suffices.

## Relation to `FiniteRankedTerminalChildCoverage.ObstacleCloseness`

`FiniteRankedTerminalChildCoverage.ObstacleCloseness` is an *assumed*
hypothesis of `FiniteRankedTerminalChildNashClosure`: it says that the three
delayed child obstacles (`lowerObstacle`, `upperObstacle`,
`deviationObstacle`) are each within `childError` of the fixed child-target
obstacle at every terminal public history.  That is a statement about the
chosen child adaptive-potential witnesses, not about the backward-Nash
selection, and terminal perturbation robustness therefore cannot *derive* it.
What this file supplies is the missing *consequence* of that hypothesis:
`ObstacleCloseness` is consumed there only to anchor the three roots within
`childError` of `parentTarget`, and the surrounding file explicitly claims no
incentive-safety for the composed object.  The theorems
`FiniteRankedTerminalChildCoverage.selection_lowerObstacle_deviation_le`,
`…_upperObstacle_deviation_le` and `…_deviationObstacle_deviation_le` below
take exactly that structure as input and conclude that the unchanged
backward-Nash selection is a `2 * childError`-equilibrium for each of the
three actual delayed obstacles.  They are stated against the real
`ObstacleCloseness` structure and need no adapter; the mismatch is only in
direction — the structure is consumed here, never produced.
