# A jointly controlled one-stage public XOR coin

Two distinct players each have two distinguished actions encoding a bit.  If
both prescribed bit marginals are uniform and the public signal is their XOR,
then every unilateral deviation leaves that signal uniform: at least one of
the two independent controller bits remains uniform.

This is only a statement about the marginal public bit.  A next-state law is
also deviation-invariant when the transition kernel factors through that bit.
Without this factorization the transition may retain information about an
individual controller's action, and the uniform XOR marginal gives no child
law guarantee.
