# Randomized recurrent children and the deviation interface

A finite stopped process can preserve a whole payoff-vector target in
expectation while selecting among lower-rank terminal children.  The
distributional statement follows directly from `OutcomeClosure.ValueProcess`.

That fact is not, by itself, a recurrent-child constructor for a public
equilibrium recursion.  The selection process must preserve the appropriate
continuation ceiling after every unilateral deviation, not merely its
expectation under prescribed play.  The one-player example below is the
smallest obstruction: prescribed public randomization selects absorbing
payoffs zero and one with mean one half, while the player can select payoff
one with certainty.

Thus randomized target preservation can replace pointwise target
preservation only after a strategic stopped-process lemma supplies:

* prescribed lower and upper continuation martingales;
* a continuation supermartingale under every unilateral deviation;
* public observability of the terminal child; and
* history rebasing of each child's public-phase certificate after the
  stopping history.

/-- A one-step public state draw whose kernel is independent of the joint
action has the same continuation law under every behavior profile.

Iterating this identity through a finite stopped selection region makes its
terminal public-child law invariant under unilateral deviations.  This is
the concrete public-coin condition missing from the counterexample below. -/
