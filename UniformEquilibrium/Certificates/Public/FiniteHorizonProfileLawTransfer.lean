# Finite-horizon profile-law transfer

A terminal payoff at horizon `fuel` depends only on behavior at stages
strictly before `fuel`.  This file records that elementary but important
interface.  Two profiles which agree at every public history before the
horizon induce the same history laws through the horizon, including after
the same unilateral behavior deviation.

The final theorem also identifies the prescribed full-history envelope at
the root with the terminal-payoff expectation for an arbitrary behavior
profile.  Neither result uses equilibrium or a special stopping rule.
