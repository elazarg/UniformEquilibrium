# Approximate target transport through a finite public selector

The fixed-depth splice does not require literal preservation of the parent
target.  If the selected expected child target is within half the requested
error, construct a certificate at that selected target using the other half
of the budget and then retarget it.

This is useful when an analytic or polyhedral construction supplies only an
approximate child lottery at the finite accuracy currently being compiled.

/-- A deviation-safe fixed-depth selector whose expected child target is
within half the requested tolerance inherits a parent adaptive certificate.

The first half of the budget constructs the selector/child splice at its
own expected target.  The second half pays for moving that target to the
advertised parent payoff. -/
