# Harmonic target transport for recurrent public children

Harmonicity transports an entire payoff vector within a finite closed
communicating class.  The constructor below uses that fact to discharge the
target field of `PublicRecurrentClassChild`.

The child entry, the identification of the parent and child targets with a
common harmonic continuation vector, the strict rank decrease, and the
legal entry interface all remain explicit hypotheses.  Positive occupation
charge alone supplies none of them.

The two-state deterministic cycle is one closed communicating class.  Its
balanced occupation has positive total charge, but an arbitrary vector may
take different values at the two states.  The missing hypothesis is exactly
harmonicity (or an equivalent target-identification condition).
