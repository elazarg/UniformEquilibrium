# Uniform equilibrium after one public draw into absorbing children

This file closes the complete verification chain for a concrete
nontrivial class of stochastic games.  From the initial state, every joint
action induces the same public one-step draw.  The draw is supported on
absorbing states, grouped into finitely many public children.

Each absorbing child has an adaptive potential equilibrium certificate.
The deviation-safe public selector transports those certificates through
the initial draw.  The parent target is their exact expectation, so the
generic verification theorem yields a uniform equilibrium payoff.

This is stronger than treating the initial state as absorbing: its stage
payoff and action profile may be arbitrary, and its transition may be a
nondegenerate lottery over several absorbing continuation games.  The
finite initial prefix disappears from every long-run average.

/-- An action-independent public draw into absorbing child states has an
adaptive potential equilibrium certificate at its initial state.

`entry_terminal` says that every named child is represented by an
absorbing state.  `terminal_entry` says that every terminal state that can
occur in the selector is the representative of its public observation.
Together they identify the selector leaves with the child certificates. -/
