# Public stage-payoff innovation scores

The realized public joint action reveals every player's realized stage
payoff. Subtracting its expectation under prescribed mixed play gives a
single bounded public innovation score. Unlike an action-frequency score,
this detector needs no fixed pure comparator:

* it is centered under prescribed joint play;
* under any comparison mixed profile, its expectation is exactly the
  comparison's one-stage payoff gain;
* under an arbitrary behavior deviation, its historywise conditional mean
  is exactly the deviation's historywise stage-payoff gain.

The final section sums these identities along stochastic-game histories.
The cumulative innovation has expected value equal to its predictable
stage-gain compensator. Pathwise it is the compensator minus an adverse
noise term, which is precisely the algebraic `comparisonLower` input used by
`HorizonFreePublicDetector`. Establishing a common measurable martingale
realization for that adverse noise belongs to the concrete play-law
compiler; no punishment closure is asserted here.
