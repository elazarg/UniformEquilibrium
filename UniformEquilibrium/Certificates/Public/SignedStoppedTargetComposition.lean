# Signed composition of child certificates at a public causal stopping time

A public selection phase runs until a bounded causal stopping time, assigns a
child to every stopped history, and hands control to that child.  This file
proves that child certificates compose to a *parent* deviation-cap/delivery
pair, and then to a parent adaptive potential certificate, from **signed and
one-sided hypotheses only**.

## The design fence

Every hypothesis about the selection phase is either

* an expectation-level two-sided bound `|E[v^J_i] - v_i| ≤ δ` (prescribed
  delivery), or
* a one-sided expectation bound `E_dev[v^J_i] ≤ v_i + δ` (deviation
  transport).

No hypothesis is a *branchwise* bound `∀ J, |v^J_i - v_i| ≤ δ`, and no
hypothesis puts an absolute value *inside* an expectation.  This is not
cosmetic: `TwoChildFence` below exhibits a fair selection between a `+1`
child and a `-1` child at which the signed hypotheses hold with `δ = 0`,
while the branchwise strengthening fails by a full unit at every branch and
its accumulated bill grows linearly in the horizon.  The composition theorem
proved here applies there; a composition theorem stated branchwise cannot.

## Layer 1: the stopped-expectation calculus

`Math.Probability.OptionalTargetTransport` supplies the transport kernel
(`ControlledTransport.stoppedExpect`, exact vector transport, the unilateral
cap).  It is *consumed* here, never reproved.  What it does not supply is the
elementary calculus needed to move from *targets* to *payoffs*: monotonicity,
constants, and additive slack.  Those are proved here
(`stoppedExpect_mono`, `stoppedExpect_const`, `stoppedExpect_add_const`,
`stoppedExpect_le_add_of_le`, `abs_stoppedExpect_sub_le_of_signed`) as
lemmas about the existing definition.

## Layer 2: the composition

* `ChildDeliveryModuli` — (H3) each child delivers its own declared target
  within `childError`, and caps its own deviator at that target plus
  `childError`.  Three signed inequalities; no absolute value.
* `SignedSelectionDelivery` — (H1) + (H2), the two expectation-level
  selection hypotheses.
* `stoppedExpect_deliveredPayoff_le` /
  `le_stoppedExpect_deliveredPayoff` /
  `abs_stoppedExpect_deliveredPayoff_sub_le` /
  `stoppedExpect_deviationPayoff_le` — the composition: the *payoff*
  functional obeys the same signed delivery and one-sided cap as the
  *target* functional, at error `selectionError + childError`.
* `signedSelectionDelivery_of_harmonic` /
  `signedSelectionDelivery_of_approxHarmonic` — (H1)+(H2) supplied by the
  transport kernel from harmonicity data, consuming
  `stoppedExpect_vector_eq_of_harmonic`,
  `stoppedExpect_current_le_of_unilateral`,
  `stoppedExpect_current_le_of_unilateral_of_error` and the two approximate
  prescribed-transport theorems.

## Layer 3: the parent

* `StochasticGame.StoppedSelectionBill` — (H4), the sublinear stopping/reset
  bill: the parent's horizon-`total` payoff *total* differs from `total`
  copies of the stopped composite value by at most a fixed boundary charge,
  signed on the prescribed side and one-sided on the deviation side.  This
  is the interface supplied by the bounded-stopping factorization files; it
  is a hypothesis here, not a claim.
* `StochasticGame.finiteAveragePayoff_le_of_signedStoppedComposition` and
  friends — **tier 1**: explicit finite-horizon parent payoff bounds
  `v i ± (selectionError + childError + boundary / total)`.
* `StochasticGame.adaptivePotentialSystemAt_of_eventualAverageBounds` —
  **tier 2**: eventual signed payoff bounds assemble an explicit
  `AdaptivePotentialSystemAt`, hence an `IsAdaptivePotentialCertificateAt`.
  The child-boundary mismatch is absorbed as the one-time bounded charge
  `boundary / total`; no exact anchoring of the child potentials at the
  parent target is assumed.
* `StochasticGame.isAdaptivePotentialCertificateAt_of_signedStoppedComposition`
  — the capstone: (H1)–(H4) give a parent certificate at any error strictly
  above `selectionError + childError`.

## Non-vacuity

`TwoChildFence` instantiates the abstract layer at a genuinely branching
selection where the branchwise hypothesis fails.  `AbsorbingAcceptance`
instantiates *all four* hypothesis bundles at once and fires the capstone,
re-deriving `exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isAbsorbingState` through it.
Without the second the capstone could be vacuous; without the first the
signed/branchwise distinction could be empty.

## What this strengthens

`PublicFixedDepthAdaptiveCertificate.isAdaptivePotentialCertificateAt_of_fixedDepthSelector`
demands `hexact`, exact preservation of the nominal child targets by the
selector.  `signedSelectionDelivery_of_exact` shows that is the
`selectionError = 0` case of (H1); (H1) is strictly weaker, and (H2) replaces
the deviation-side exactness that
`PublicRandomStoppedAdaptiveSplice.IsDeviationStoppedTargetInvariant` states
as an *equality* by a one-sided *inequality*.  The stopping rule here is a
causal predicate on histories, so the stopping time is genuinely variable
(bounded by the selection horizon), not a fixed depth.  No sign condition on
child scalar charges (`NonnegativeChildScalarCharges`) appears anywhere.
`signedSelectionDelivery_of_branchwise` records that the branchwise
hypothesis implies the signed one, and `TwoChildFence` records that the
implication is strict.

/-- **Tier 2: certificate assembly from eventual signed payoff bounds.**

Constant potentials anchored *exactly* at the target, with the residuals
carried by *signed* (never truncated, never absolute) scalar charges, turn
eventual finite-horizon payoff bounds into an explicit adaptive potential
system.  Every monotonicity clause holds with equality; every stage clause
holds with equality; the whole content sits in the three Cesàro charge
bounds, which are precisely the three payoff hypotheses.

Truncating the charges at zero (`max 0 _`) would be the branchwise/absolute
variant and is exactly what this construction avoids. -/

The parent's horizon-`total` payoff *total* is compared with `total` copies
of the stopped composite value.  The gap is a single fixed `boundary` charge
— the finite selection prefix plus the one-time child-boundary mismatch —
independent of `total`, so it is sublinear and washes out in the average.

is one-sided.  Nothing here is branchwise. -/

/-! ## Acceptance test: the hypothesis bundle is satisfiable

A composition theorem whose hypotheses are jointly unsatisfiable proves
nothing.  This section instantiates *all four* hypothesis bundles at once —
`SignedSelectionDelivery`, `ChildDeliveryModuli`, `StoppedSelectionBill`,
and the error budget — and fires the capstone, re-deriving the known
absorbing-state uniform equilibrium payoff
(`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isAbsorbingState`) through the new
interface.  The selection phase used is the empty one, which is the honest
minimal witness: the interface must not secretly demand a nontrivial
selection. -/
