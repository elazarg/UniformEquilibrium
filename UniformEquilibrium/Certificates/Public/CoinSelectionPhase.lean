# Potential and charge accounting for a finite public-coin phase

A deviation-safe public coin fixes the terminal-child law independently of
play.  This file turns that law into the three potential inequalities needed
during the finite selection prefix.

The potential at a public state is the expected target of the eventual child.
It is exactly harmonic under prescribed play and every unilateral deviation.
The stage charge is the absolute gap between this continuation target and the
current expected payoff, cut off when the selection fuel is exhausted.  Its
total expected mass is at most
`fuel * (payoffBound + targetBound)`.

This is only the finite selection prefix.  No child certificate is extended
after the stopping history here; suffix rebasing and the child charge remain
separate splice fields.
