# Responder-floor comparison from unilateral credibility

This file isolates the value comparison underlying the implication from
responder credibility to the responder-floor condition.

For a responder strategy `response` and a coalition strategy `coalition`, let
`floorPayoff response coalition` be the payoff in the floor game and let
`responsePayoff response coalition` be the payoff in the actual response
game.  If the floor payoff is pointwise no larger than the response payoff,
then, against any fixed prescribed coalition strategy,

`sup_response inf_coalition floorPayoff`

is no larger than

`sup_response responsePayoff response prescribedCoalition`.

Consequently, a unilateral credibility bound on the latter value implies the
same bound on the security floor.  The proof records the load-bearing facts
explicitly: the same responder strategy type is used in both games, the fixed
prescribed coalition strategy is an admissible floor-game coalition strategy,
and the payoff comparison holds for every strategy pair.

The repository does not yet contain a finite turn-based absorbing response
arena and its derived floor game.  This module therefore formalizes only
the reusable strategy-level comparison, without introducing an architecture
interface ahead of that model.

/--
The floor-game security value is at most the actual-game unilateral value
against a fixed coalition strategy, provided actual payoffs dominate floor
payoffs pointwise.

The boundedness assumptions are exactly those needed to use `sInf` and `sSup`
over `ℝ`; they are automatic for finite bounded-payoff games.
