# Target transport from a finite public terminal Nash system

Backward Nash selection on a finite public-history tree produces an
endogenous root payoff.  The actual prescribed terminal-history law is a
lottery whose expected whole payoff vector is exactly that root payoff.
Consequently, when the public state space is finite, the root payoff belongs
to the convex hull of the terminal-history payoff vectors.

This does not identify the endogenous root payoff with an externally
prescribed analytic target, nor does it turn terminal histories into legal
lower-rank continuation children.
