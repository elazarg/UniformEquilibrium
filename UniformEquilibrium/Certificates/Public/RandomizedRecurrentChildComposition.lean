# Randomized recurrent-child composition

This file records the equilibrium-level consequence of the fixed-depth
public-coin splice.

A deviation-safe selector has a terminal-child law which is independent of
the complete behavior profile used during selection.  If that law transports
the whole child payoff vector to the parent target, every terminal selector
state is the advertised child entry state, and every child target has an
adaptive-potential equilibrium certificate, then the parent target has one
as well.  Hence it is a uniform-equilibrium payoff.

The conditioning interface used for a deviation spanning both phases is made
explicit below: after conditioning on a fixed-depth public base, the root
deviation becomes `afterHistoryStrategy deviation base`, a legal behavior
strategy in the selected child game.  No independent pre/post deviation
split is assumed.

The only selection loss in the underlying constructor is the finite charge

`fuel * (payoffBound + targetBound)`.

At requested error `δ`, an Archimedean accounting horizon makes its Cesàro
contribution at most `δ / 2`; child certificates are invoked at error
`δ / 2`.  Thus the bounded prefix causes no asymptotic loss.

There is one important scope restriction.  `DeviationSafePublicCoinSelector`
identifies the game transition with its stopped kernel at every state.  Its
terminal states therefore self-loop under every joint action.  The theorems
below close the whole-vector target seam for that globally stopped interface,
but do not construct the variable-stopping-time splice needed to enter a
nonabsorbing recurrent child immediately when a merely local
`FinitePublicCoinStoppingRegion` terminates.
