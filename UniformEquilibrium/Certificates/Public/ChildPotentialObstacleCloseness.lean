# Producing delayed child-obstacle closeness from child certificates

`FiniteRankedTerminalChildCoverage.ObstacleCloseness` is the one hypothesis
of the fixed-depth composition chain that was assumed rather than derived:
it says that the three delayed child obstacles (`lowerObstacle`,
`upperObstacle`, `deviationObstacle` of `delayedData`) sit within
`childError` of the fixed child-target obstacle at every terminal public
history.  `FinitePublicTerminalNashPerturbation` *consumes* that structure;
nothing produced it.

This file produces it, from the child adaptive-potential witnesses alone.

## The mechanism

A `FiniteRankedTerminalChildCoverage` requires its stopping rule to select
the endpoint at the common depth (`selector_eq_last`).  Hence the realized
stopped suffix of every complete public history is *empty*
(`rootOnlineStoppedPath_eq_append_empty_of_selector_eq_last`), and the
delayed obstacle at a terminal history is exactly the selected child
system's time-zero potential at its own entry state
(`lowerObstacle_eq_child_initial` and its two twins).  That value is
compared with the child target by the `lower_initial` / `upper_initial` /
`deviation_initial` fields of `AdaptivePotentialSystemAt`, which are bounded
by the family accuracy.  No error is lost: the produced closeness constant
is the family accuracy `childError` itself, not a multiple of it.  The
finite-time `3 * error` triples of
`AdaptivePotentialFiniteTimeTargetBounds` are therefore not needed here;
they bound potentials at *positive* times, whereas the terminal coverage
only ever evaluates the child witnesses at time zero.

## What is proved

* `lowerObstacle_eq_child_initial`, `upperObstacle_eq_child_initial`,
  `deviationObstacle_eq_child_initial` — the exact pointwise identities.
* `abs_lowerObstacle_sub_targetObstacle_le` and twins — the three closeness
  bounds in exactly the shape of the `ObstacleCloseness` fields.
* `obstacleCloseness` — the producer: the literal
  `coverage.ObstacleCloseness family` structure, for *every* family, with no
  extra hypothesis.
* `delayedObstacleClosure` and `delayedObstacleClosure_of_certificates` —
  the end-to-end chain: childwise adaptive-potential certificates alone
  give a `2 * childError`-equilibrium of the unchanged backward-Nash
  selection for the three actual delayed obstacles, together with the three
  `childError` root anchors at the endogenous parent target.
* `lowerObstacle_close_iff` and `not_lowerObstacle_close_of_lt` (and twins)
  — sharpness: closeness at a bound holds *iff* every observed child's
  time-zero gap is below that bound, so no bound smaller than a realized
  child gap can be produced.
* `terminalOnlineStoppingRule`, `canonicalStateCoverage` and
  `nonempty_finiteRankedTerminalChildCoverage` — the coverage hypothesis is
  inhabited for every finite-state game and every depth, so the producer is
  not vacuous; `canonicalStateCoverage_obstacleCloseness` and
  `canonicalStateCoverage_delayedObstacleClosure_of_certificates` run the
  whole chain on that inhabited coverage.

/-! ### Inhabiting the terminal coverage

The producer below is unconditional in the child family, so its content
depends on `FiniteRankedTerminalChildCoverage` being inhabited at all.  It
is: the never-stopping first-hit region supplies a complete online rule
whose view is empty before the fuel and whose selector is the endpoint, and
observing the terminal state itself supplies a total legal child
assignment. -/
