# Finite ranked terminal-child Nash closure

**Partial prototype.**  This is *not* a closure certificate for a
well-founded public child recursion.  It only covers a fixed common terminal
depth, and its root estimates are conditional on the `ObstacleCloseness`
hypothesis, which is assumed rather than derived here.  Genuine early
stopping requires a stopped-tree Nash transfer theorem, which is not yet
available.

What is actually established.  Assume that every terminal public history at
the common depth `fuel` is assigned a legal child with the same entry state,
and that every child has strictly lower rank.  Then:

* the delayed child dispatcher agrees with the backward-induction profile at
  every stage strictly before `fuel`
  (`dispatcher_profilesAgreeBefore`);
* under `ObstacleCloseness`, the delayed lower, upper, and prescribed
  deviation roots each sit within one child error of the endogenous parent
  target (`lower_root_close_parentTarget`, `upper_root_close_parentTarget`,
  `prescribedDeviationRoot_close_parentTarget`).

The output payoff is endogenous: it is the backward-induction Nash payoff of
the fixed terminal child-target obstacle (`parentTarget`).  No external
parent target is preserved.  The selected profile is independent of the
requested accuracy.

Stopping exactly at the common terminal depth is essential to what is proved
here: it is what makes the delayed dispatcher agree with the
backward-induction profile throughout the terminal-payoff game.  No error
budget is allocated in this file, and no incentive-safety statement for the
composed object is claimed.

The rule is required to reveal no child before `fuel` on any public history,
