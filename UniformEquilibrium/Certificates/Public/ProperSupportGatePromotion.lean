# The five-gate proper-support promotion bundle (easy direction)

A strict analytic support inclusion `supp_A(C) ⊊ A` is a *routing signal*, not
a child-construction theorem.  The canonical proper-support promotion theorem
is a **relative** statement: the promoted whole-target child exists exactly
when five independent finite gates hold for one and the same cell-labelled
child datum.

This file bundles those five gates as named structures and proves the **easy
direction**: the bundle produces the promotion output.  The promotion output
is the existing `PublicRecurrentClassChild` — a canonical child carrying the
parent's *whole* payoff-vector target together with strict rank descent — plus
the remaining components of the output tuple.

## The five gates, verbatim

1. **Common support realization.**  All rows on `C` are realized
   simultaneously by one public behavioral profile and one total update rule;
   the analytic circulation lifts to an actual invariant occupation on the
   resulting owner-labelled public product.
   → `CommonSupportRealization` (built on `CommonProfileRowRealization`).
2. **Complete target compatibility.**  A complete child target and target
   field satisfy the recurrent identities, every owner-labelled Bellman
   inequality, the parent target-balance equations, and the exact
   target/rebasing fibers, all in the same realization cell.
   → `CompleteTargetCompatibility`.
3. **Robust finite entry synthesis.**  A parent-to-boundary target field, bias
   potentials, neutral-occupation inequalities, total updates, exact boundary
   maps, and explicit nonentry fallbacks satisfy the entry conditions.
   → `RobustFiniteEntry`.
4. **Target-constrained germ coherence.**  The child datum is the restriction
   of the parent germ, or is supplied by a restarted target-constrained germ
   with a compatible interface, or by a controlled all-accuracy approximation.
   → `TargetConstrainedGermCoherence`.
5. **Hereditary intrinsic progress.**  After minimal strategic closure and
   canonical bisimulation quotient, every reachable descendant of the child has
   strictly smaller canonical global rank than the parent.
   → `HereditaryIntrinsicProgress`.

`FiveGateData` bundles all five; `FiveGateData.promote` and
`FiveGateData.output` are the easy direction.

## Honest status of each gate

* **Gate 1 is faithful and partly banked.**  The realization equations are
  written at the level of the actual game: *one* state-indexed product profile
  `prescribed` occurs in the prescribed row and in every response row, which is
  exactly the answer's decisive compatibility condition (its equation (8) is
  enforced by using the same variable, not by a side equation).  The existing
  development discharges precisely this half:
  `AnalyticBellmanGerm.fixedOccupationActionDist_bind_transition`
  (`PlayerNeutralOccupationBehaviorRealization.lean`) is definitionally the
  `rows_realized` field, and `finkStateKernel` is definitionally the realized
  prescribed kernel; see `CommonProfileRowRealization.ofFinkActiveOccupation`.
  The occupation lift (the answer's (10)–(11)) and the closed reachable class
  are *not* supplied by that development and stay as fields.
* **Gate 2 is faithful** for the answer's displayed finite system: the
  whole-target conditions (17), the recurrent identity (19), the owner-labelled
  Bellman inequality (20) with one potential per owner and one multiplier per
  owner, the child entry target (15), and the parent target balance.  The
  remaining clauses of the answer's witness set (22) — exact target/rebasing
  fibers, account resets, owner-history compatibility, canonical face — are
  *not* modelled; they are collected in one neutral socket `CellFiber`, which
  is trivially satisfiable when instantiated by `fun _ => True`.  That is an
  explicit gap, not a claim.
* **Gate 3 is faithful** for (27), (28), (32), (33), the `Z = E ⊔ B ⊔ F`
  decomposition and the *deterministic-bound* form of the stopping condition
  (the answer's third and strongest stopping variant: acyclicity of the
  positive-support graph inside `E`, here witnessed by a strictly decreasing
  `exitRank`).  The martingale/supermartingale delivery (37) and the entry-debt
  bound (35)–(36) are **not** derived; they need stopped-process machinery.
  What *is* derived here: no reachable closed prescribed class inside `E`
  (`no_closed_class_in_continuing`), no deviation self-loop inside `E`
  (`no_deviation_selfLoop`, which is exactly the answer's entry
  counterexample (39)), and the exact neutral-occupation condition (31) from
  the finite dual (32) (`neutralOccupation_charge_nonpos`).
* **Gate 4 is faithful only for the inherited/restarted alternatives**:
  the endpoint equation (41)/(42) and the interface commutation (40), stated
  over neutral type parameters because the tree has no analytic restriction
  map on germs.  The controlled all-accuracy approximation (43), with its
  residual moduli and approximation calendar, is **omitted**.
* **Gate 5 is faithful** to the hereditary formulation, with the descendant
  relation, the node rank, and the rank order left as parameters (the tree's
  `AnalyticEndpointLexRank`/`AnalyticEndpointDeflationRank` are legal
  instantiations).  The reflexivity field `self_descendant` is load-bearing;
  see `hereditaryProgress_descends_vacuous_without_self`.

## Gates 4 and 5 are components of the conclusion

The answer states this itself: *"Germ coherence and strict global progress are
components of the tuple itself."*  Consequently the easy direction is genuinely
contentful only for gates 1–3 (which manufacture the child, its whole target,
and its legal entry); gate 4 is carried through unchanged and gate 5 is
instantiated at the child.  No gate field is literally the conclusion:
`target child = target parent` is *derived* from gate 2's harmonicity by
`ReachableClosedClass.harmonicVector_eq_entry`, and `rankLt (rank child)
(rank parent)` is obtained from gate 5 by `∀`-instantiation at the child.

## Falsifier probes

Every new `Prop`/structure was checked against a trivial witness:

* `CommonSupportRealization.classRows_nonempty` — the zero occupation cannot
  satisfy gate 1: normalization plus the support equivalence (11) forces the
  class row set to be nonempty.
* `no_deviation_selfLoop`, `no_closed_class_in_continuing` — gate 3 is not
  satisfied by the answer's entry counterexample (39), where `U ≡ 0` verifies
  (28) yet a deviator stays forever.
* `CompleteTargetCompatibility.recurrent_charge_coboundary` — with a zero
  target field, gate 2 still forces the prescribed payoff to be an exact
  coboundary of the bias, i.e. mean charge zero on every recurrent class
  (the answer's (21)).  The zero witness is therefore admissible only for a
  game with zero recurrent payoff, which is correct.
* `hereditaryProgress_descends_vacuous_without_self` — the `descends` field
  alone is satisfied by the empty descendant relation while the conclusion
  fails; this is why `self_descendant` is a field.
* `germEndpoint_not_sufficient` — the answer's Part D counterexample: two child
  germs with the same endpoint vector and different strategic interfaces.  The
  endpoint field of gate 4 alone does not imply the commutation field.
* The neutral socket `CellFiber` *is* vacuous under `fun _ => True`; that is
  documented above as a gap rather than a modelled condition.

## What this file does not do

The converse (a successful promotion supplies the five gates) is not proved.
The two rank counterexamples of Part E (redundant support; reactivation under
closure) are not formalized here; they bear on the converse and on whether
gate 5 can be *derived* from proper support, which it cannot.

/-! ## Gate 4: target-constrained germ coherence -/

/-- **Gate 4.**  The selected child target is the endpoint of a germ whose
strategic realization is the strategic restriction of the parent's.

This covers the inherited case (`childGerm = restrict parentGerm`, with
`restrict` folded into the choice of `childGerm`) and the restarted case with a
compatible interface morphism, i.e. the answer's (40)–(42).  The controlled
all-accuracy approximation (43) is **not** modelled.

The types are neutral parameters because the tree currently has no analytic
restriction map `R_C^an` on `AnalyticBellmanGerm`; instantiating `Interface` by
a subsingleton makes `commutes` vacuous, so faithfulness of this gate depends
entirely on the instantiation. -/

/-- **Falsifier probe for gate 4 / the answer's Part D counterexample.**  Two
child germs may have the same endpoint vector and different strategic
interfaces.  The `endpoint` field alone therefore does not imply the
`commutes` field: a germ with the correct numerical endpoint can be unrelated
to the selected strategic child. -/

quotient, *every* reachable descendant of the child has strictly smaller

descent field is satisfied by the empty descendant relation while the strict
descent at the child fails.  The reflexivity field is therefore not
decoration. -/
