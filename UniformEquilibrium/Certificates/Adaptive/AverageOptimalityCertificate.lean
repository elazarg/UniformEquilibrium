# The Stationary Average-Optimality (Guarantee) Certificate

A **stationary, undiscounted** sufficient condition for
`StochasticGame.IsOneSidedGuaranteeCertificate` — a player securing a value
against *every* opponent completion — built directly from the undiscounted
average-reward Bellman (LP-dual) optimality inequalities for a fixed
stationary policy, with **no discount factor and no `1/λ` anywhere**.

## Why this file exists

The discounted route to a uniform value guarantee converts a discounted
Bellman certificate to an average-payoff guarantee via a `β / (1 − β)`
rescaling that diverges as the discount `λ := 1 − β → 0`: a proved wall (recorded in an
untracked local research note). The escape is to certify the
average payoff *directly*, with a **bounded, state-dependent benchmark `ρ`**
(the "gain") and a **bounded bias `u`** satisfying the classical undiscounted
average-reward optimality inequalities for a stationary policy — exactly the
shape `TransitionIndependentCertificate.lean`'s Poisson-equation certificate
uses for the *no-control* case (`Math.MeanErgodic.exists_harmonic_add_poisson`,
an exact identity there because the opponent has no real choice). Here the
policy must be **robust against every opponent action**, so the identity used
there weakens to a pair of *inequalities* holding against every opponent
action — this is precisely **Vrieze's primal LP for undiscounted stochastic
games**: the gain variable `ρ` satisfies a one-step transition inequality
against every action, and the bias variable `u` satisfies the
payoff-plus-continuation inequality against every action. This file is the
Lean object that LP's feasible solutions are certificates *for*; solving that
LP (e.g. via the single-controller/no-control special cases already in this
repository) is the natural continuation, not attempted here.

## The two drift inequalities

For a stationary (behavior-independent-of-time, state-dependent) mixed action
`mwho : G.State → PMF (G.Act who)`, a bounded gain `ρ : G.State → ℝ` and a
bounded bias `u : G.State → ℝ` witness a **guarantee of `vwho` from below**
when, for *every* state `s` and *every* joint opponent action `b` (`who`'s own
coordinate of `b` is irrelevant — it gets overridden by the actual mixed draw
from `mwho s`):

* **gain drift** (`ρ` subharmonic): `ρ s ≤ E[ρ (S') | s, mwho s, b]`
* **bias drift**: `ρ s + u s ≤ E[g_who (s, A) + u (S') | s, mwho s, b]`

where `A := Function.update b who a` for `a` drawn from `mwho s`, and `S'` is
the resulting next state. Both are **inequalities**, deliberately not the
equalities of a genuinely harmonic/Poisson potential: an equality can only be
maintained *on the equilibrium path* (or for a *fixed*, uncontrolled chain, as
in `TransitionIndependentCertificate.lean`); against an adversarially chosen
opponent action `b` there is in general no equality available, only that
neither drift term can be negative. This is exactly enough: telescoping the
bias drift and using the gain drift's submartingale consequence
(`E[ρ (S_t)]` nondecreasing in `t`, hence `≥ ρ s₀` at every `t`) gives

  `E[∑_{t < N} g_who] ≥ N · ρ s₀ − 2 ‖u‖_∞`,

hence `finiteAveragePayoff ≥ ρ s₀ − 2 ‖u‖_∞ / N`, uniformly in the horizon and
against *every* opponent completion — the `IsOneSidedGuaranteeCertificateAt`
shape, with the `2 ‖u‖_∞ / N` boundary term vanishing as `N → ∞`. **No
discount, no `1/λ`, appears anywhere in this telescope.**

(The dual **capping-from-above** certificate — used to bound a minimizer's
own payoff, or equivalently a maximizer's deviation gain against a fixed
opponent policy — is obtained by reversing both inequalities, `ρ`
*super*harmonic and `ρ s + u s ≥ E[g + u (S')]`; it is not built as a separate
object here because `IsOneSidedGuaranteeCertificate` already gets both
directions for free: applying `IsStationaryAverageGuaranteeCertificate` to
*each* player of a zero-sum game and composing with
`isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isZeroSumBoolGame_of_oneSidedGuarantees`
turns each player's own *lower* guarantee into the *other* player's deviation
cap, matching the zero-sum wrapper's own design.)

**Reward-shift invariance.** The certificate is stated purely in terms of the
two *drift* inequalities (differences of expectations, never a raw scaled
quantity such as `(1 − λ)/λ · v`): shifting every stage payoff by a constant
`c` shifts `ρ` (and the guaranteed value) by `c` but leaves both drift
inequalities unchanged, since the added constant cancels inside
`E[· (S')] − ·(s)`. This is what keeps the certificate genuinely
discount-free and rules out the divergent `1/λ` rescaling that blocks the
discounted route.

## Main definitions

* `StochasticGame.stationaryFrom` — the time-independent behavior strategy
  induced by a state-dependent mixed action
* `StochasticGame.IsStationaryAverageGuaranteeCertificate` — the certificate:
  a stationary mixed action together with a subharmonic gain `ρ` and a bias
  `u` satisfying the two drift inequalities against every opponent action

## Main results

* `StochasticGame.isOneSidedGuaranteeCertificate_of_isStationaryAverageGuaranteeCertificate`
  — the certificate implies `IsOneSidedGuaranteeCertificate`, via the bounded
  undiscounted telescope described above
* `StochasticGame.IsAbsorbingEverywhere` /
  `StochasticGame.isStationaryAverageGuaranteeCertificate_of_isAbsorbingEverywhere`
  — the validating instance: a game absorbing at *every* state (so the drift
  inequalities are trivial, `ρ` and `u ≡ 0` exact) reproves the one-sided
  guarantee at every state's stage-game *security* (maximin) level — genuinely
  adversary-robust, unlike the repository's existing absorbing-state examples
  which only certify Nash play
* `StochasticGame.isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isZeroSumBoolGame_of_stationaryAverageGuarantees`
  — the zero-sum assembly: two stationary average-guarantee certificates (one
  per player) give a full `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`, via the existing
  zero-sum wrapper

## Status / next step

Steps 1–2 (the certificate and its bounded-telescope reduction to
`IsOneSidedGuaranteeCertificate`) are complete and sorry-free. Step 3 is
validated on the absorbing-everywhere instance. The natural continuation —
*solving* Vrieze's primal LP for a genuine single-controller stochastic game
(not merely a disjoint union of one-shot games) to produce a
non-trivially-moving instance of this certificate — is intentionally left as
future work; it needs LP/optimality machinery this file does not build.

This file is deliberately **not** wired into `GameTheory.lean` (the project
aggregator): it is a standalone verification object, importable directly.

-- ============================================================================

/-- **Stationary average-optimality (guarantee) certificate.** Player `who`
has a stationary mixed action `mwho`, a bounded gain `ρ : G.State → ℝ` with
`vwho ≤ ρ s₀`, and a bounded bias `u : G.State → ℝ`, such that against
*every* state `s` and *every* joint opponent action `b` (`b`'s `who`
coordinate is irrelevant, since it is overridden by `mwho s`'s own draw):

* **gain drift** (`ρ` subharmonic under `mwho`, for every opponent choice):
  `ρ s ≤ E_{a ~ mwho s}[ E[ρ (S') | s, Function.update b who a] ]`
* **bias drift**: `ρ s + u s ≤
  E_{a ~ mwho s}[ g_who (s, Function.update b who a) +
    E[u (S') | s, Function.update b who a] ]`

These are the undiscounted average-reward (LP-dual) optimality inequalities
for the stationary policy `mwho`, required to hold against *every* possible
opponent behavior (not merely a fixed chain), and are what
`isOneSidedGuaranteeCertificate_of_isStationaryAverageGuaranteeCertificate`
consumes to certify `who` securing `vwho` via a bounded, discount-free
telescope. Both `ρ` and `u` are automatically bounded (`G.State` is finite);
that boundedness is exactly what makes the telescope's boundary loss vanish
as the horizon grows. -/
