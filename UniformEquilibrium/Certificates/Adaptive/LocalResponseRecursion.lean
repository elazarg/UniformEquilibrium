# Goal-generic well-founded local-response recursion

Several packaging layers in this directory repeat one and the same
construction: state-indexed nodes ranked by a well-founded relation, a root
pinned to the ambient entry state and target payoff, two explicit strategic
witnesses, and a local closer that may consult only strictly lower-ranked
children.  Only the *conclusion* of the closer changes between them: a
public-phase punishment system, an expectation-level adaptive potential
certificate, and so on.

This file isolates that skeleton once.

* `LocalResponseNodes` is the static ranked-node data with its root pinning.
* `LocalResponseRecursionAt Goal` fixes one accuracy `δ` and closes `Goal` at
  every node from `Goal` at its strictly lower-ranked children.
* `AccuracyPolymorphicLocalResponseRecursion Goal` keeps the accuracy
  quantifier inside the induction hypothesis, so a parent closing at `error`
  may request a child at any other positive accuracy such as `error / 2`.

`Goal` is an arbitrary predicate on an entry state, a target payoff, and an
accuracy.  No strategic content is added or removed by this file: the closers
are hypotheses, and the only theorems are the two well-founded compilations.

/-- The static skeleton shared by every well-founded local-response
construction: nodes carrying an entry state and a target payoff, ranked by a
well-founded relation, with a distinguished root pinned to `s₀` and `v`.

Ranking through `rank : Node → Rank` rather than directly on `Node` is what
lets a construction reuse one node at several ranks. -/

end LocalResponseNodes

/-- One completed well-founded local-response recursion at accuracy `δ`,
generic in the local goal predicate `Goal`.

`closeLocalResponse` is the application-facing induction step. Its recursive
argument can only be invoked on a node of strictly lower rank, and returns
`Goal` at that child's own entry state and target payoff. This state-indexing
prevents a projected or hidden-belief core interface from being silently
replaced by the root problem.

The two strategic compatibility propositions are deliberately abstract
because their concrete statements depend on the local-response construction;
their proofs remain mandatory node-indexed fields and are passed explicitly
to the closer. -/

/-- A well-founded local-response recursion whose induction hypothesis gives
each strictly lower-ranked child the goal at *every* positive accuracy.

Finite-prefix splices need this variance: to close at error `error` they
request children at strictly smaller errors such as `error / 2`.

Allowing both strategic interfaces to depend on the requested accuracy
preserves the actual quantifier order: a local implementation chosen for one
tolerance need not serve at every other tolerance. -/
