# `TransitionIndependent`'s uniform equilibrium payoff, via the certificate

Stage 3 of the adaptive-certificate generalization program: re-derives
`StochasticGame.exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isActionIndependent`
(`GameTheory.Concepts.Stochastic.Classes.TransitionIndependent`) through the
adaptive certificate machinery of `Certificates/Adaptive/Certificate.lean`,
using a genuinely **non-constant** history potential built from the
relative-value (Poisson equation) of the induced autonomous Markov chain —
instantiating the "decoupled" flavor of the "V2" interface
(`StochasticGame.IsAdaptiveDecoupledEquilibriumCertificate`), because (as with
the Big Match, but for a different reason) no potential *close to the target
everywhere* is available here either: the Poisson potential `u` is bounded
but not close to any single constant unless the chain happens to be flat.

## The Poisson-equation potential

For an action-independent game with autonomous kernel `κ`, per-state mixed
stage-Nash equilibrium `x`, and player `who`, the stage-Nash payoff function
`f who := fun s => G.mixedStageEU s (x s) who` decomposes
(`Math.MeanErgodic.exists_harmonic_add_poisson`, already proved — this file
does *not* need to re-extract the Poisson-solvability statement, since that
theorem already *is* it) as `f who = o who + (κ-step (u who) - u who)` for a
**harmonic** component `o who` (`∀ s, expect (κ s) (o who) = o who s`) and a
**Poisson potential** `u who`. Harmonicity makes the *expectation* of
`o who` along the chain started at `s₀` constant in time
(`expect_iter_of_harmonic`), equal to `o who s₀`, *even when `o who` is not
itself a constant function of state* (e.g. several recurrent classes): this
is the general mechanism, no "single recurrent class" restriction is
actually needed for the certificate construction below. Substituting this
into the decomposition and telescoping over the autonomous chain's one-step
transition gives an **exact** (zero-error) Bellman identity for the history
potential `φ who t h := -(u who h.2)` against the *constant* target
`v who := o who s₀`: `v who + E[φ who t] = payoff t who + E[φ who (t + 1)]`.
Since `u who` is a fixed function on the finite state space it is bounded,
but generally *not* close to `v who` anywhere — exactly the situation
`IsAdaptiveDecoupledCertificateAt` (not `IsAdaptiveCertificateAt`, "V1") was
built for.

The deviation clause reuses `TransitionIndependent.lean`'s own mechanism:
action-independence keeps the state marginal identical under every
deviating profile, so (a) the potential's expectation is unaffected by any
deviation, and (b) stage-Nash optimality caps the deviator's stage payoff by
the on-path stage payoff at the same state — together giving the deviation
clause with zero error too.

## Main results

* `Math.PMFIter.expect_iter_of_harmonic` — a harmonic
  observable's expectation along the chain is constant in time
* `GameTheory.StochasticGame.isAdaptiveDecoupledEquilibriumCertificate_of_isActionIndependent`
  — the Poisson-equation certificate construction
* `GameTheory.StochasticGame.exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isActionIndependent_via_certificate`
  — `TransitionIndependent`'s result, re-derived through the certificate

This file is deliberately **not** wired into `GameTheory.lean` (the project
aggregator): it is a standalone validation of the certificate interface
against a second worked example, not a new standing result that other files
depend on. Import it directly if needed.

/-- **The relative-value (Poisson equation) certificate for action-independent
games.** For every action-independent `G`, the "decoupled V2" certificate
holds at `s₀` with target `v who := o who s₀`, the harmonic component of the
Poisson decomposition of the stage-Nash payoff `fun s => G.mixedStageEU s
(x s) who` — with *zero* error (`e ≡ 0`) throughout, since every clause is
an exact algebraic identity or an exact domination fact, not merely an
`O(1/T)`-vanishing approximation. -/
