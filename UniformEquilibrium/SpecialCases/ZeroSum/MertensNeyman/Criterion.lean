# The Abstract Mertens–Neyman Criterion

This file states and proves, from explicit analytic hypotheses, the abstract
(conditional) form of the Mertens–Neyman criterion for the uniform value of a
two-player zero-sum stochastic game: bounded payoffs, together with a
**tail-variation modulus** for the discounted-value family and an
**adaptive-index one-step tracking estimate**, imply that a genuinely
history-adaptive strategy secures the vanishing-discount limit value up to
`ε` over all sufficiently long horizons (Stage B), which assembles into a
uniform equilibrium payoff for a zero-sum presentation (Stage C).

The point of this file is the *contract*: the precise shape of the
hypotheses (`IsTailVariationBounded` above all) that a later, purely
algebraic construction must discharge. Where the deepest quantitative
estimate of Mertens–Neyman (1981) would be needed to *discharge* a
hypothesis rather than merely to state it, this file promotes the residual
to an explicit, precisely named hypothesis instead of `sorry`ing it — see
the module docstring notes on `IsRowIndexTrackingCert` below.

## Three-layer structure

The Stage B/C material is organized into three layers, deliberately kept
separate so that the *assembly* layer never has to know how its inputs were
built:

1. **The tracking certificate (the contract).**
   `StochasticGame.IsRowTrackingCertificate` (row side) and
   `StochasticGame.SecuresCol` (column side) name the bare finite-horizon
   securing guarantee each player's strategy must meet — nothing about
   discount families, tail variation, or adaptive indices appears in either
   definition.
2. **Constructors (mechanism-specific).** Two conditional ways to build a
   row tracking certificate are proved here:
   * `trackingCertificate_of_discountBiasControl` ("mechanism 2") — from
     `IsTailVariationBounded` plus the promoted `IsRowIndexTrackingCert`
     hypothesis, along the canonical calendar schedule.
   * `trackingCertificate_of_runningDeficit` ("mechanism 3") — from the
     concrete `IsRowDeficitIndexSecuring` property for the linear
     running-surplus index candidate, choosing its index parameters at the
     requested error level. This constructor is logically valid, but
     `BigMatchDeficitIndexNoGo.lean` shows that the candidate is not a
     universal way to obtain its premise.
   The `StageBSchedule` section's no-go remark (`tendsto_atTop_calSched_ratio`)
   is exactly why a *third*, more naive constructor — deriving mechanism 2's
   `IsRowIndexTrackingCert` hypothesis directly from `IsShapleyFamily` and
   the plain, *unscaled* `IsTailVariationBounded` — does not exist: the
   scaled bias jump `(1 - lam) / lam · V` that a correct average-reward
   Bellman conversion needs diverges as `lam → 0⁺`, so unscaled tail
   variation alone does not imply the discount-bias control mechanism 2's
   constructor assumes as a hypothesis instead of deriving.
3. **Assembly (mechanism-neutral).**
   `uniformValue_of_rowColumnTrackingCertificates` takes exactly the two
   certificates from layer 1 and concludes `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` — its
   signature mentions neither `IsTailVariationBounded` nor any other
   construction mechanism, so it applies verbatim to certificates built by
   either conditional constructor or any other mechanism.

## Stage A: the discounted-value family and its contract

* `StochasticGame.IsTailVariationBounded` — the tail-variation modulus, in
  **interval-envelope** form: for every `ε`, some `δ` bounds the
  `Function.eVariationOn` total variation of `v` over the *whole interval*
  `(0, δ)` by `ε`. This bounds `‖v a - v b‖` for every pair `a, b ∈ (0, δ)`
  regardless of order — deliberately *not* a chain-order (monotone-only)
  bound, since the realized Mertens–Neyman adaptive discount index generally
  moves non-monotonically along a play. This is the exact statement a
  concrete algebraic construction (the "F1" file) must produce.
* `StochasticGame.IsTailVariationBounded.pairwise_le` — the two-point
  (`m = 1`) instance: a genuine Cauchy criterion for `v` as `λ → 0⁺`.
* `StochasticGame.IsTailVariationBounded.exists_vanishingDiscountLimit` — the
  vanishing-discount limit `v₀ := lim_{λ→0⁺} v λ` exists, proved by the
  Cauchy criterion and completeness of `G.State → Payoff ι` (a finite-rank
  real vector space under the sup norm).
* `StochasticGame.IsShapleyFamily` — the general Shapley/Fink one-step
  property tying `v λ` to the stationary optimal profile `x λ` at discount
  complement `λ = 1 - β`, matching `BellmanVariety.lean`'s `λ`-convention and
  `Fink.lean`'s `IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanEq`.
* `StochasticGame.IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanEq.value_zeroSum` and
  `rowValue_eq_discountedShapleyValue` — in a zero-sum game, every discounted
  Bellman equilibrium has antisymmetric values and its row coordinate is the
  canonical Shapley fixed point.

## Stage B: the one-sided (maximizer-role) guarantee

* `StochasticGame.IsRowIndexTrackingCert` — the promoted one-step tracking
  estimate: the adaptive-index potential `v (λ (t, h)) (state h)` is a
  historywise near-supermartingale, up to a per-stage error budget `e`,
  under the row player's `λ`-indexed strategy, against *every* opposing
  play. It is the abstract quantitative interface an adaptive-index
  argument must supply; it is a hypothesis rather than a consequence of
  `IsShapleyFamily` and `IsTailVariationBounded` (see the definition's
  docstring for the logical gap).
* `StochasticGame.trackingCertificate_of_discountBiasControl` — **the core
  reduction, mechanism 2's constructor**: bounded payoffs,
  `IsTailVariationBounded`, and `IsRowIndexTrackingCert` (supplied along the
  canonical vanishing calendar schedule) together give the maximizer-role
  finite-horizon guarantee, packaged as an `IsRowTrackingCertificate`.
  `IsTailVariationBounded` is used directly inside the proof to bound the
  cumulative tracking error by `ε`, uniformly in the horizon. (The
  deprecated alias `secures_vanishingDiscountLimit_row` still resolves.)

### The zero-sum row/column protection bridge (`StageAB`) and its limits (`StageBSchedule`)

`IsRowIndexTrackingCert` is an explicit hypothesis in this file. Two
theorems delimit what follows from the discounted data and what requires an
additional adaptive construction:

* `StochasticGame.IsShapleyFamily.le_row_discountedPayoff` (and its column
  mirror `le_col_discountedPayoff`) — the missing zero-sum bridge: at a
  *single, fixed* discount level `lam`, `IsShapleyFamily` plus `IsZeroSum`
  plus the value antisymmetry derived by `value_zeroSum` together give
  row's actual `lam`-discounted Shapley-style security guarantee against
  *every* history-dependent column deviation (built from
  `IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanEq.row_bellman_ge`, the zero-sum companion to
  Fink's own `deviation_bellman_ge`, which only caps the *deviator's own*
  payoff and says nothing about the non-deviating player without zero-sum).
* `StochasticGame.IsShapleyFamily.isDiscountedStationaryBellmanSchedule_calSched`
  connects `IsShapleyFamily` along the canonical calendar to
  `FinkSchedule.lean`'s `IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanSchedule` — the
  *correctly discount-scaled* (`β/(1-β)`) time-varying verification layer
  that a genuine history-adaptive argument needs. `tendsto_atTop_calSched_ratio`
  then makes precise **why this still does not discharge
  `IsRowIndexTrackingCert`**: `IsTailVariationBounded` controls the
  *unscaled* jump `‖v lam - v lam'‖`, but the scaling factor `(1-lam)/lam`
  that a correct average-reward Bellman conversion needs diverges as
  `lam → 0⁺`, so it does not control the *scaled* bias jump
  `FinkSchedule.lean`'s `IsScheduledFinkSwitchBound` requires.
  Therefore the unscaled variation hypothesis alone cannot produce the
  required switch bound. An additional history-adaptive construction with
  a summable error budget is required.

## A rejected linear running-surplus index (`AdaptiveIndex`)

This section records and analyzes a simple history-adaptive candidate. Its
elementary properties and the conditional implications of its crossing
budget remain useful diagnostics, but it is not the Mertens–Neyman
constructor:

* `StochasticGame.rowRunningSurplus` / `rowIndexDenom` / `rowDeficitIndex` —
  the candidate index: the row player's *realized* running surplus over a
  target `w`, its linearly growing clamped denominator, and the resulting
  discount-complement index
  `δ / rowIndexDenom`. `rowIndexDenom_snoc_of_le` gives the one-step update
  law; `rowDeficitIndex_pos`/`_le`/`_mem_Ioc`/`_lt_one` give its range facts;
  `rowDeficitIndex_eq_of_surplus_zero` / `_two_eq_calSched_of_surplus_zero`
  confirm it is a strict generalization of `calSched`, recovered exactly
  when the realized surplus stays at `0`.
* `StochasticGame.IsShapleyFamily.rowDeficitIndex_bellman_le` — the one-step
  tracking attempt, generalizing `BigMatchUniform.lean`'s `bfX_le_expect_step`
  to the abstract discounted-value family along `rowDeficitIndex`. It
  succeeds at a *weaker* shape than `IsRowIndexTrackingCert` (the adaptive
  potential's own one-step drift, with no external scalar target and no
  `stageEUAt` term) — see its docstring for the exact algebraic point where
  strengthening it further re-encounters the `β / (1 - β)` divergence, now
  fully explicit rather than a qualitative remark.
* `StochasticGame.rowDeficitTrackingGap` /
  `IsRowDeficitCrossingBound` — the signed expectation-level error whose
  partial sums retain the cancellation discarded by an absolute residual,
  and the exact uniform crossing budget required of those sums.
  `sum_rowDeficitTrackingGap` proves its telescope, while
  `isRowDeficitIndexSecuring_of_crossingBound` proves that this budget and a
  bounded indexed value potential imply the concrete securing residual.
* `StochasticGame.IsRowDeficitIndexSecuring` — a concrete conditional
  interface replacing `IsRowIndexTrackingCert`'s abstract index choice by
  the statement that, at every requested error level, some
  `rowDeficitIndex`-indexed strategy secures the target `w` over long
  horizons. The index parameters may depend on the requested error, as a
  uniform ε-optimal strategy must; after they are chosen, they are
  independent of the opposing strategy and the horizon.
* `StochasticGame.trackingCertificate_of_runningDeficit` — **mechanism 3's
  constructor**: repackages `IsRowDeficitIndexSecuring`'s already-fixed
  witness strategy as an `IsRowTrackingCertificate`. Pure existential
  introduction, not a proof of its premise.

`BigMatchDeficitIndexNoGo.lean` supplies the decisive acceptance test. On the
all-Right live path, discounted Big-Match Bellman equilibria force this
index to stop with a harmonic-order hazard. Those hazards are nonsummable,
the live probability tends to zero, and the corresponding actual game
payoff against all-Right tends to zero rather than the value `1/2`. A
universal proof therefore needs a different adaptive index and budget
invariant; the Blackwell–Ferguson square hazard illustrates the missing
summability.

## Stage C: assembly to a uniform equilibrium payoff

* `StochasticGame.IsRowTrackingCertificate` / `StochasticGame.SecuresCol` —
  the row- and column-side tracking certificates, layer 1 of the three-layer
  structure above: bare finite-horizon securing guarantees, with no
  reference to discount families or variation.
* `StochasticGame.uniformValue_of_rowColumnTrackingCertificates` — **the
  mechanism-neutral assembly theorem**: combining a row and a column
  tracking certificate through `isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_deviation_caps`
  gives the two-player zero-sum uniform equilibrium payoff `(w, -w)`. Its
  signature carries no variation hypothesis whatsoever — `IsTailVariationBounded`
  is absent, by design; only the two certificates from layer 1 are consumed.
  The column-side guarantee is the mirror image of the row side (row and
  column swapped, sign of the target flipped) and is taken here as a
  hypothesis of that shape rather than re-derived, to keep this file's scope
  bounded — the construction is identical with `0` and `1` exchanged. (The
  deprecated alias `isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_secures_row_col` still
  resolves.)

section StageA

variable {ι : Type} (G : StochasticGame ι) [Fintype ι] [Fintype G.State]

/-- **The tail-variation modulus (interval-envelope form).** For every
`ε > 0` there is a `δ > 0` such that the (extended-real) total variation of
`v`, in the sense of `Function.eVariationOn`, over the *whole interval*
`(0, δ)` is at most `ε`.

This is deliberately an **interval**, not a chain-order, control: the
realized Mertens–Neyman adaptive discount index generally moves
non-monotonically along a play (it can both decrease and increase, driven by
the running deficit between realized and target payoff), so a bound that
only controls decreasing chains of discount-complements would not bound the
value swings actually encountered along a play. `Function.eVariationOn`
instead bounds `‖v a - v b‖` for *every* pair `a, b ∈ (0, δ)` regardless of
order (`eVariationOn.edist_le`, used in `pairwise_le` below) — the
interval-envelope contract, in the terminology of Mertens–Neyman's original
`λ`-update construction (design (b) of the two envisaged here; design (a),
a plain chain-order bound, would only be sound if the realized index were
known to be pathwise monotone, which it is not in general).

`eVariationOn`'s definition already subsumes the *unweighted-density*
picture `∃ ψ ≥ 0` with `∫_0^δ ψ < ∞` and `‖v b - v a‖ ≤ ∫_{min a b}^{max a b}
ψ`: any such `ψ` gives `eVariationOn v (Ioo 0 δ) ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (∫_0^δ ψ)`
(a consequence of `MeasureTheory.intervalIntegral` additivity, not
re-derived here), and conversely bounded variation is itself represented by
its own indefinite-variation function. For the concrete real-valued
row/column discounted values used in Stage B/C, `MonotoneOn.eVariationOn_le`
gives the cheapest bridge: eventual monotonicity of `fun lam => v lam s who`
on `(0, δ)` together with a bound on its total drop there,
`ENNReal.ofReal (f b - f a)`, discharges this hypothesis directly — exactly
the "eventual monotonicity + ordinary tail bounded variation" shape a
concrete vanishing-discount construction (`F1b`) is expected to export.

The norm is the sup norm on `G.State → Payoff ι`, i.e. `G.State → ι → ℝ`
under Mathlib's finite-Pi instance (`Pi.normedAddCommGroup`, applied twice):
`‖f‖ = sup over states s, players i, of |f s i|`. This choice composes
cleanly with `norm_le_pi_norm`, which lets the sup bound be read off
pointwise at any single state and player without further work. -/

### The zero-sum row/column protection bridge

`IsShapleyFamily` only records that `(x lam, v lam)` is a **Nash**
equilibrium of the discounted auxiliary games (`IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanEq`,
via `IsDiscountedAuxNash`): no *unilateral deviation* by either player
improves their own payoff. On its own, in a general (non-zero-sum) `n`-player
game this says nothing about what a *non*-deviating player is guaranteed
against an opponent's deviation — Fink's own corollaries
(`IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanEq.deviation_finiteAveragePayoff_le`) only cap
the *deviator's own* payoff.

In a two-player **zero-sum** game this gap closes: column having no incentive
to deviate, transported through the zero-sum identity, is *exactly* row's
security-level guarantee against every column response (the classical fact
that Nash equilibria of zero-sum games are saddle points). The theorems below
formalize this transport, both for the row and the column player, from
`IsDiscountedStationaryBellmanEq`/`IsShapleyFamily` plus `IsZeroSum` plus the
**value zero-sum** side condition `v lam s 1 = -v lam s 0`.

The value zero-sum condition follows from Bellman consistency itself:
the sum of the two value coordinates is a strictly discounted harmonic
function and therefore vanishes. The Nash inequalities then identify player
zero's value with the unique fixed point of the Shapley operator. -/

/-- In a zero-sum game, the value coordinates of every discounted stationary
Bellman equilibrium are negatives of one another. Bellman consistency makes
their sum a `β`-discounted harmonic function; when `0 ≤ β < 1`, the sup-norm
contraction forces that sum to vanish. -/

/-- **The adaptive one-step tracking estimate** (the promoted hypothesis).
Along the row player's `λ`-indexed strategy, against *every* opposing column
strategy `dev`, the running-index potential `v (λ (t, h)) (state h)` is a
historywise near-supermartingale up to a per-stage error budget `e t`. This
is precisely the quantitative content of the Mertens–Neyman `λ`-update: it
generalizes `BigMatchUniform.lean`'s `bfX_le_expect_step` /
`bfXExpect_le_succ` submartingale step from the Big Match's concrete
potential to the abstract discounted-value family `v`.

It is *not* derived here from `IsShapleyFamily` and `IsTailVariationBounded`
directly. Doing so needs, at every history, comparing the fixed-`λ` Shapley
Bellman equation at the running index `λ (t, h)` against the one-step
continuation evaluated at the successor index `λ (t + 1, h')`, which first
requires passing to the *average-reward normalization* of the discounted
Bellman equation (`averageReward_bellman_le_of_discounted_bellman_le` in
`Discounted.lean` is exactly this conversion, but only for a single *fixed*
`β`) before the discrepancy between the two indices can be bounded by the
tail-variation modulus. The history-adaptive-`β` generalization of that
conversion lemma is the exact missing step, and is promoted here. -/

### The linear running-surplus candidate

`calSched`/`calScheduleHist` above is a **calendar** schedule: it depends only
on elapsed time `t`, never on how play has actually gone. The candidate in
this section also responds to the realized running surplus between
accumulated payoff and a target. It is defined as the Lean object
`rowDeficitIndex`; its denominator update, range bounds, and calendar
special case are elementary.

The construction only superficially resembles
`BigMatchUniform.lean`'s `netRightExcess`/`bfDenom` mechanism. In particular,
its denominator contains an extra calendar term and its induced Big-Match
stopping hazard has first power rather than the Blackwell–Ferguson square.
`BigMatchDeficitIndexNoGo.lean` proves that this difference is fatal on the
all-Right path.

`rowDeficitIndex_bellman_le` below then attempts the one-step tracking
estimate against arbitrary opposing play, generalizing
`BigMatchUniform.lean`'s `bfX_le_expect_step`. It succeeds at a *weaker*
shape than `IsRowIndexTrackingCert` (no external scalar target, only the
potential's own one-step drift). The conditional crossing interface at the
end of the section records what would suffice for this candidate, without
asserting that the interface follows from the discounted hypotheses.

actual accumulated stage payoff recorded along the history `h` (via
`totalPayoff`, read off the history's own recorded `(state, action)` pairs —
*not* an expectation), in excess of `w` charged once per elapsed stage.
Positive means row has actually earned above the target `w` so far along
this specific play; negative means row is running a realized deficit below
`w`. It is analogous to `BigMatchUniform.lean`'s `netRightExcess`, but is
driven by row's realized payoff rather than solely by the opponent's
realized action. -/

/-- **A one-step estimate for the linear candidate.** This compares the Big
Match's concrete `bfX_le_expect_step` pattern with an abstract
discounted-value family `v` along the `rowDeficitIndex` update law.

The bound splits into exactly the two pieces the module docstring's
`StageBSchedule` remark identifies: (1) a fixed-`λ₀ := rowDeficitIndex …  t
h` discounted-to-average conversion slack, from `row_bellman_ge` applied at
the *single* discount level `λ₀`, bounded by `λ₀ * (C + Cv)` (`C` bounds
stage payoffs, `Cv` bounds `v`); and (2) the *index-jump* slack from
evaluating the continuation at the *adaptive* successor index `λ (t+1) h'`
instead of the fixed `λ₀`, bounded by `ε` via the unscaled tail-variation
pairwise bound `hpair` (an instance of `IsTailVariationBounded.pairwise_le`).

This succeeds at a *weaker* shape than `IsRowIndexTrackingCert`: the
conclusion bounds the adaptive potential's own one-step drift (matching
`bfXExpect_le_succ`'s role exactly), but carries **no external scalar
target** `w` and **no `stageEUAt` term** on the right — `IsRowIndexTrackingCert`
additionally needs `target + v(λ₀) ≤ stageEU + E[v(λ')] + e`, i.e. needs the
*fixed-λ₀* slack `λ₀ * (stageEU - E_fixed[v(λ₀)])` (not just its absolute
bound `λ₀ * (C + Cv)`) to be dominated by `stageEU - w` for *every* possible
opposing deviation. `IsRowDeficitCrossingBound` below isolates the stronger
signed-average property that would be sufficient, without claiming it holds
for this candidate. -/

/-- **Conditional securing interface for the linear candidate.** For each
requested error, some `rowDeficitIndex δ N w` strategy secures the target
`w` over every sufficiently long horizon and against every column
deviation. The index parameters and horizon threshold are chosen before the
deviation and horizon; the side conditions keep every realized index in
`(0, 1)`.

This property is stronger and more concrete than leaving an arbitrary
history-dependent index existentially unspecified. It is intentionally a
premise, not a claimed consequence of `IsShapleyFamily` or tail variation.
The Big-Match obstruction in `BigMatchDeficitIndexNoGo.lean` rejects the
linear index as a universal constructor, while the implications from this
property remain logically useful. -/
