# Split-domain gain--bias verification

There are two genuinely different relevant domains here.  Prescribed
delivery is asserted on `R = ⋃ i, R_i`, while unilateral caps for player `i`
are asserted only on `R_i`.  The older `ClosedResponseRegion` cannot express
this split: its `prescribed_unilateral` field requires its prescribed domain
to lie in every owner arena.

This module adds the smallest separate foundation needed by that statement:
declared entries, a delivery domain, owner-specific arenas, the two inclusions
identifying delivery with their union, and independent prescribed/unilateral
support closure.  Two private-purpose adapters let existing theorems consume
the appropriate half without refactoring `ClosedResponseRegion`.

The main result is the sound gain--bias sufficiency direction on the exact
split domains.  The module also records that the existing mean-ergodic and
controlled-Farkas theorems already synthesize the prescribed and unilateral
biases once their respective hypotheses are available.  It does not prove the
asymptotic-property converse, recurrent coverage, necessity, or a fifth
obstruction theorem.
