# Rectangular mixed-player continuation compatibility

Bellman inequalities owned by player `i` depend only on player `i`'s
continuation coordinate. Separate playerwise feasibility therefore implies
simultaneous feasibility when the permitted continuation set is a product
of player-coordinate sets.

This file formalizes that sufficient condition and builds it directly into a
public-response branching recursion. The recursion's compatibility branch is
no longer an opaque proposition: it contains one whole-vector continuation
satisfying every coordinate permission and every player-owned linear
inequality.

The condition is genuinely restrictive. Coupled continuation sets such as
the diagonal segment in `FinkContinuationCompatibilityCounterexample` are
not rectangular and are intentionally outside the theorem.
