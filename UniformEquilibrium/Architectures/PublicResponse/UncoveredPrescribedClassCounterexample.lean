# The two-node uncovered prescribed-class counterexample

This module formalizes the minimal two-node counterexample.  Player
one cannot leave the entry node while player two follows the prescription;
player two can deviate once and enter a second prescribed-absorbing node.
Player one's prescribed payoff is zero at the entry and one at the escaped
node, while the proposed target is zero everywhere.

The game API has state-independent action types, so player two's Boolean
action remains syntactically available at the escaped node; both choices have
the same absorbing transition and zero payoff there.  This is behaviorally the
state-dependent singleton action set of the underlying counterexample.

The support-pruned target, owner-occupation, and nonnegative prescribed
delivery checks all pass.  Nevertheless exact prescribed target delivery and
the prescribed Poisson equation fail when play is restarted at the escaped
node, which lies outside player one's arena.

The current `IsReachableCredibilityCriterion` deliberately supports its
prescribed stationary occupations only on `R.prescribed`.  Here that set is
the singleton entry node.  To match the counterexample's broader nonnegative
test as closely as the present APIs permit, this file additionally proves
the *global* `IsPrescribedDelivery` predicate and exhibits the positive
escaped stationary occupation explicitly.  No converse or general
fifth-obstruction API is introduced.
