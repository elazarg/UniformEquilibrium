# Boundary-rate tests for Fink calendars

This file isolates two facts about the remaining projective-boundary calendar
problem.  First, waiting cannot in general be preloaded for free: for a
decreasing positive hold cost, summable total hold cost bounds activation time
times the preceding hold cost.  Thus sufficiently fast growth of the next
endpoint cost is incompatible with terminal amortization.

Second, the genuine exact-tail branch has no rate obstruction.  If the next
reference exposed by the root correction is exact from some point onward, the
verified fast corrected branch survives annealing and gives corrected calendar
selectability without any dilation hypothesis.

/-- A preload obstruction for every slow unit-step calendar.  If `h` is a
positive decreasing hold cost and the block-weighted hold bill is summable,
then activation time for layer `n + 1` times `h n` stays bounded.  Consequently
an endpoint cost `A (n + 1)` with `A (n + 1) * h n → ∞` cannot be amortized at
the activation times.  This shows that pointwise vanishing of the hierarchy
defect alone cannot imply the missing calendar compatibility. -/
