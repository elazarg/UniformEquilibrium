# A permanent no-go boundary: unscaled tail variation does not control discount bias

This file is wired into the root `GameTheory.lean` build; it is nonetheless a standalone,
self-contained record of a boundary fact for the uniform-equilibrium program, and does not import
or edit `MertensNeymanCriterion.lean` (its abstract predicates are re-declared here, independently,
to avoid interfering with concurrent work on that file).

## The point

Converting a discounted Bellman inequality into an average-payoff (uniform-value) statement needs
multiplying by the factor `(1 - λ)/λ`, which diverges as `λ → 0`. The algebraic-selection machinery
of `Math.AlgebraicSelection` (the "F1a/F1b" bridge) shows that a value curve `v` selected by a
nonzero bivariate polynomial has vanishing **unscaled** tail variation as `λ → 0⁺`
(`Math.tailEVariation_vanishes_of_polynomial_root`). It is tempting to hope that this algebraic
control is already enough to also bound the **scaled**, discount-rescaled quantities that a
vanishing-discount argument actually needs. This file records, once and for all, that it is *not*:
there is an algebraic (indeed quadratic) value curve whose unscaled tail variation vanishes, yet
whose scaled, shift-invariant (centered) discount-bias curve has *unbounded* oscillation on every
tail interval. So the algebraic infrastructure alone cannot bridge the unscaled/scaled gap; some
extra ingredient (uniform boundedness of the derivative, or a genuinely different argument) is
needed.

## Predicates

* `IsTailVariationBounded v` — the **unscaled** tail-variation modulus, in coordinatewise
  interval-envelope form: for every `ε > 0` there is `δ > 0` such that, for every coordinate
  `s : S`, the total variation (`eVariationOn`) of `fun lam => v lam s` on `Set.Ioo 0 δ` is at
  most `ε`. (Coordinatewise rather than `S`-Pi-valued: this is the shape
  `Math.tailEVariation_vanishes_of_polynomial_root` produces per coordinate, and avoids
  Pi-metric bookkeeping that is orthogonal to the point of this file.)
* `IsDiscountBiasVariationBounded v s0` — the analogous bound on the **scaled, centered** Bellman
  drift. Since there is no transition structure here, the natural "shift-invariant" surrogate for
  the discount bias is the *centered* scaled difference
  `scaledCenteredDrift v s0 lam s := (1 - lam) / lam * (v lam s - v lam s0)`
  at a fixed reference coordinate `s0` (centering at `s0` is what makes this invariant under
  `v ↦ v + c` for a constant `c`, exactly as a genuine discount-bias quantity is). The predicate
  demands the same `ε`-`δ` interval-envelope bound on `eVariationOn` of this scaled, centered
  curve. A direct two-point (Cauchy) consequence, `IsDiscountBiasVariationBounded.pairwise_le`, is
  what the witness below actually refutes.
* `IsAlgebraicBranch v` — each coordinate `fun lam => v lam s` is, on some interval `Set.Ioo 0 ρ`,
  a continuous branch selected by a nonzero bivariate polynomial in the sense of
  `Math.bivEval` (exactly the hypothesis shape `Math.AlgebraicSelection` works with).

## The witness and the headline theorem

`vWitness : ℝ → Fin 2 → ℝ := fun lam => ![0, Real.sqrt lam]` is algebraic (coordinate `0` is the
`v = 0` branch of `P = X`; coordinate `1` is the `v² = λ` branch of `P = X² - C(X)`), has vanishing
unscaled tail variation (coordinate `0` is constant, coordinate `1` has variation `≤ √δ → 0`), but
its scaled centered drift at reference coordinate `0`,
`scaledCenteredDrift vWitness 0 lam 1 = (1 - lam) / lam * Real.sqrt lam`, is *unbounded* on every
tail interval: sending `lam → 0⁺` along the second point of a two-point comparison drives this
quantity to `+∞` (while the first point's value stays fixed), which is exactly what
`IsDiscountBiasVariationBounded.pairwise_le` forbids. The three facts are exported separately:

* `isAlgebraicBranch_vWitness`
* `isTailVariationBounded_vWitness`
* `not_isDiscountBiasVariationBounded_vWitness`

and the top theorem `not_forall_algebraicBranch_tailVariationBounded_imp_discountBias`
is immediate from these three.

/-- **Unscaled tail-variation boundedness**, coordinatewise: for every `ε > 0` there is `δ > 0`
such that, for every coordinate `s`, the total variation of `fun lam => v lam s` on `Set.Ioo 0 δ`
is at most `ε`. This is the "algebraic-selection"-facing hypothesis
(`Math.tailEVariation_vanishes_of_polynomial_root` produces exactly this, per coordinate). -/

/-- The **scaled, centered** discount-bias curve at reference coordinate `s0`: the discounted
Bellman-drift surrogate `(1 - λ)/λ · (v λ s - v λ s0)`. Centering at `s0` makes this invariant
under adding a constant to all of `v` (`v ↦ v + c` leaves `scaledCenteredDrift` unchanged), matching
the shift-invariance a genuine discount-bias quantity has. -/
noncomputable def scaledCenteredDrift {S : Type*} (v : ℝ → S → ℝ) (s0 : S) : ℝ → S → ℝ :=
  fun lam s => (1 - lam) / lam * (v lam s - v lam s0)

/-- `scaledCenteredDrift` is unchanged by adding the *same* constant `c` to every value of `v`:
the shift-invariance that motivates centering. (Adding a coordinate-dependent shift would *not*
be invariant, since it would move `v lam s` and `v lam s0` by different amounts.) -/

`δ > 0` such that, for every coordinate `s`, the total variation of the scaled centered curve
`fun lam => scaledCenteredDrift v s0 lam s` on `Set.Ioo 0 δ` is at most `ε`. This is the scaled
analogue of `IsTailVariationBounded` that a genuine vanishing-discount (Mertens–Neyman-style)
argument needs; the witness below shows algebraicity plus `IsTailVariationBounded` does *not*
imply it. -/

`MertensNeymanCriterion.IsTailVariationBounded.pairwise_le`: any two points of a small enough tail
interval have scaled-centered-drift values within `ε` of each other. This is the form the witness
below directly refutes. -/

/-- **Algebraicity**: every coordinate is, on some interval `Set.Ioo 0 ρ`, a continuous branch
selected by a nonzero bivariate polynomial — exactly `Math.AlgebraicSelection`'s hypothesis shape
(`P ≠ 0`, `ContinuousOn` on `Set.Ioo 0 ρ`, `Math.bivEval P lam (v lam s) = 0`). -/

`1` is `Real.sqrt`. Both are algebraic, both have vanishing unscaled tail variation; but the

small enough that `(1 - lam₂) / lam₂ * √lam₂ = (1 - t ^ 2) / t ≥ |C| + 2`, so the two values differ
by more than `1`, contradicting the pairwise Cauchy bound. -/
