# Player-owned flows do not imply continuation compatibility

This file gives a finite Fink-shaped counterexample to a tempting
continuation-gluing step.

There are two states, two players, and two pure transitions.  The baseline
law is uniform; the positive and negative actions lead deterministically to
the corresponding state.  For each player the two transition-difference
columns sum to zero with nonnegative weights, so every player has an exact
owned circulation.

The permitted continuation profiles are coupled diagonally by one scalar
`x ∈ [0,1]`.  Player zero can satisfy all of their inequalities at `x = 1`,
and player one can satisfy all of theirs at `x = 0`, but no common `x`
satisfies both.  The obstruction is the mixed positive circuit consisting
of player zero's lower bound `x ≥ 2/3` and player one's upper bound
`-x ≥ -1/3`.
