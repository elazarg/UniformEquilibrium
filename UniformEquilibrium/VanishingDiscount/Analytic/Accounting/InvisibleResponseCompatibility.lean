# Compatibility or public evidence for invisible responses

Suppose every member of a finite response family lies in the high-order
branch of the discount-scale drift dichotomy. Its transition drift is then
`t ^ q` times an analytic quotient. The endpoint quotient levels either are
the pairings of all endpoint transition differences with one common
potential, or finite linear compatibility supplies a signed dependence.

In the incompatible branch, orienting that dependence to have positive
quotient charge selects one fixed response. That response cannot have the
same analytic transition germ as its baseline: otherwise its quotient level
would vanish. Hence one fixed destination-coordinate monitor has a positive
power-law drift in the selected orientation.

This is a local evidence theorem. It does not assert that the selected
response is a credible punishment, nor does it construct a public phase
recursion.

/-- If the endpoint quotient levels are not represented by one common
potential, a signed incompatibility witness selects a fixed owned response
and a fixed oriented destination coordinate with positive power-law drift.

The quotient identity is precisely the high-order conclusion supplied by
`analytic_finiteStateTransitionDrift_dichotomy`. The theorem uses the
actual forward transition curve; the Boolean sign orients only the public
coordinate score. -/
