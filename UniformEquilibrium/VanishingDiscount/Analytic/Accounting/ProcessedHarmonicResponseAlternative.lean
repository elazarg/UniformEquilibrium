# Public-response or sublinear-gain closure of the processed harmonic branch

The complete moving response-gain identity leaves one endpoint term outside
the harmonic continuation account: the endpoint stage gain.  Finiteness of
the invisible-response family gives the exact operational alternative.

* If one endpoint stage gain is positive, analyticity turns the same action,
  owned by the same player, into a fixed `AnalyticFinkStagePublicResponse`.
* Otherwise every endpoint stage gain is nonpositive.  The correction slack
  is nonnegative, so the full moving corrected gain is bounded above by the
  absolute moving analytic remainder.  Its positive part therefore has a
  sublinear cumulative expectation along the universal calendar, uniformly
  over arbitrary history laws and predictable behavioral mixtures.

This closes the analytic/accounting part of the processed harmonic response
branch.  It does not construct the phase strategy that realizes a supplied
behavioral selector.
