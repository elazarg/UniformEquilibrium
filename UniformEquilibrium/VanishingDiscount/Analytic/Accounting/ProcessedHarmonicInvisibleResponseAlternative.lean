# Finite quotient alternative for processed invisible responses

Fix a player and a processed lower value jet.  Suppose every invisible
endpoint-neutral action lies in the high-order branch at the lower-jet
scale, with an analytic quotient.

Finite linear compatibility gives an exact operational alternative:

* one scalar state potential represents every quotient against the actual
  endpoint transition difference; adding its player-coordinate embedding to
  the processed jet makes every indexed continuation gain nonpositive; or
* one actual invisible action owned by the fixed player has a fixed bounded
  oriented transition-coordinate signal with a positive power-law margin.

The second branch is public statistical evidence.  Its Boolean orientation
does not reverse the action and does not assert that the action is a
profitable or credible punishment.  The first branch is an endpoint
absorption statement, not yet a bounded realized account: the new potential
need not be harmonic under the endpoint baseline kernel.
