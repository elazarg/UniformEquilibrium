# Public action-frequency innovations under behavior deviations

A fixed analytic stage response supplies a selected player and action. Its
public action-frequency score is already centered and bounded at one stage.
This file carries that score through arbitrary finite public histories.

The resulting cumulative statistic has three exact descriptions:

* its conditional mean is the selected action's probability excess;
* its expectation under any history-dependent comparison behavior is the
  expectation of the predictable cumulative excess;
* pathwise it is that compensator minus a centered adverse-noise term.

This is the maximal behavioral activation datum implied by the fixed public
score. It supplies the algebraic `comparisonLower` field of the horizon-free
detector without assuming that the comparison is stationary or pure.
Constructing the common measurable martingale realization and choosing a
credible target-preserving continuation remain separate play-law and
strategic obligations.
