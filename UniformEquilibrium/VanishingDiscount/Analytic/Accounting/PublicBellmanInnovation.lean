# Public Bellman innovation scores

A completed public stage reveals both the joint action and the successor
state.  For a fixed state potential, subtract the prescribed conditional
expectation of

`stage payoff + successor potential`

from its realized value.  The resulting score is centered under prescribed
play.  Under an arbitrary comparison behavior profile, its conditional mean
is exactly the comparison's stage-payoff gain plus its transition-potential
drift.

This is the canonical one-step statistical interface for a Bellman response.
It detects a supplied profitable comparison; it does not select a punishment
continuation or prove that the comparison remains profitable after a phase
change.
