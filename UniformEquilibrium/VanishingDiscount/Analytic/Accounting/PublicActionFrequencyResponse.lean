# Public action-frequency responses and the enforcement boundary

Joint actions and states are part of `StochasticGame.Hist`. Thus a selected
stage-response action has a direct public score: its realized indicator minus
its prescribed mixed-action probability. The score is bounded by one,
centered under prescribed mixing, and its drift under another mixed action is
exactly the amount by which that action is overweighted.

Contextual regret, stitched concentration, and sublinear charge ledgers can
control the statistical use of such bounded centered scores. They do not
choose a credible punishment profile, prove its sequential incentive
constraints, or preserve the node's target payoff. The final interface
therefore isolates the remaining strategic datum as a closer returning the
existing public-phase certificate. A finite one-state counterexample proves
that a positive public detector alone cannot supply this closer.
