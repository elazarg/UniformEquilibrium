# Oriented extraction from analytic stochastic responses

After a common ramification, the Laurent--Puiseux data of a finite signed
response family are ordinary real-analytic germs. A positive total charge
then has one fixed edge carrying at least its average share. The signs of
the two factors on that edge stabilize together, and each oriented factor
has a power-law lower bound.

The orientation changes only the public coordinate score. The transition
used in the visible branch is always the given forward PMF. If the forward
and baseline PMFs coincide, the extracted charge is transition-invisible
and must be accounted for as a stage-payoff charge.

The signed flow-balance equation is deliberately absent: analytic extraction
uses only the positive total charge. Implementable circulation is a separate
question about the actual occupation cone.

The selected response is fixed across the punctured germ. Its baseline and
forward kernel curves are either identical as right germs, or one fixed
oriented destination coordinate has its own positive power-law drift. -/
