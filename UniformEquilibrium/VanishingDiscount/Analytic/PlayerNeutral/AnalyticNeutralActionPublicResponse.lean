# Analytic public responses from a positive endpoint neutral action

A continuation-neutral action with positive endpoint bias charge is already
an operational public response at the endpoint.  Analyticity makes this
response persistent: the same actual action has positive total Bellman charge
on a punctured neighborhood, with a power-law margin.

Moreover, one of two fixed operational branches persists.  If the endpoint
stage gain is positive, the same stage response remains positive.  Otherwise
the endpoint continuation gain is positive, and the endpoint coordinate
monitor extracted from that gain keeps positive forward drift.  Thus no
time-dependent action, sign, or monitor is selected.

Continuation neutrality itself is only an endpoint condition.  This theorem
does not claim that the continuation gain against the endpoint value remains
zero away from the endpoint.
