# Finite rank for iterated player-neutral deflation

The first strict player-neutral deletion can be flattened into a node over
the original finite occupation-index type.  Its active subtype is equivalent
to the existing `ZeroDriftIndex`, while its exceptional set is exactly the
strict set already equipped with an occupation budget.

`Math.FiniteDeflationIteration` proves that any continuation expressed by
properly shrinking these ambient active sets is well founded and provides an
additive support calculus for exceptional accounts.

This resolves the combinatorial termination issue, but not yet the
dependent analytic iteration issue.  The current
`PlayerNeutralStrictLeadingDrift` structure is specialized to a potential
over the original full `PlayerNeutralOccupationIndex`.  By contrast, the
next potential in `ZeroDriftAnalyticPotentialJet` is over the restricted
`ZeroDriftIndex`.  It therefore cannot be supplied definitionally to the
same strict-drift constructor.  Repeated analytic iteration needs either:

* a strict-leading-drift structure parameterized by an arbitrary ambient
  active finset and its restricted column family; or
* an explicit extension of each residual potential back to the fixed
  ambient type, with all missing-column drift charged to the accumulated
  exceptional account.

No public strategy or recurrent-child claim is made here.
