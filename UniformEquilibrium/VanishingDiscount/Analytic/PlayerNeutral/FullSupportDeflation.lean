# Operational deflation in the player-neutral full-support branch

A reachable recurrent class with full active state support cannot decrease
the state-support coordinate.  The strict leading drift that precedes this
branch nevertheless deletes a nonempty finite set of operational columns.
Consequently a third, operational-family coordinate decreases strictly even
when both harmonic rank and state-support rank remain unchanged.

The same deleted set has sublinear expected pure use and predictable mixed
mass under every source-compatible implementation.  Thus the analytic
deflation step has both ingredients needed for well-founded bookkeeping:

* a strict finite rank decrease on the retained operational family;
* a sublinear account for the exceptional family removed at the step.

This resolves the combinatorial stagnation of the full-support analytic
branch.  It does not identify the child's whole payoff-vector target,
construct a legal public entry into the residual problem, or prove
punishment credibility.  Those are strategic reconstruction obligations,
not rank defects.

An isolated full-support circulation need not carry such a decrease.  The
decrease here uses information present in the actual analytic atlas leaf:
the full-support class is reached only after a strict leading-drift
certificate has removed its nonempty exceptional set.
