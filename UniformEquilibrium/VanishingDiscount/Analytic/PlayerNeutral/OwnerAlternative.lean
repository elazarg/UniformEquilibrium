# Common-pole analytic player-neutral alternative

Apply the finite-owner charged occupation-flow alternative simultaneously
to every player's moving family of prescribed transitions and
continuation-neutral actual actions.

For a fixed bias, either one player has an analytic positive charged
circulation in that player's operational family, or all players have
analytic scaled occupation potentials sharing one pole-clearing order.
This remains a finite flow certificate and does not construct a strategy.
