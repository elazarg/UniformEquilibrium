# Analytic player-owned occupation alternative

For one player, consider the full operational family consisting of every
prescribed baseline transition and every pure action of that player.  A
deviation column carries its moving stage-plus-continuation gain against a
fixed bias, while a baseline column has zero charge.

The generic analytic charged-flow alternative then gives an exhaustive
choice:

* a positive charged circulation using only transitions available to that
  player; or
* a pole-cleared analytic potential controlling every one of that player's
  actual actions.

Unlike the player-neutral restriction, the potential branch has no
strict-action shadow or restart seam.  This file records the analytic
alternative and its pointwise game semantics.  It does not yet compile the
potential into a calendar account or the circulation into a punishment.
