# Player-owned charge as an exact Bellman account

The full player-owned occupation charge is exactly the difference between
the actual stage-plus-continuation value of an owned transition and the
prescribed stage-plus-continuation value at the same source.  This identity
is the semantic bridge needed to use a full-family charged-flow potential
against arbitrary unilateral behavior.

Both statements are the player-owned instance of the generic oriented
account of `OccupationBellmanAccountIdentity`, whose orientation is the
pair of projections of an owned state/action row.
