# Player-owned analytic occupation responses

The occupation circulation supplied by the unrestricted family of all pure
deviations can mix deviations owned by several players. Such a mixed
circulation need not decompose into a circulation available to the owner of
the selected response.

For unilateral implementation the correct unconditional construction is to
run the analytic occupation alternative on the smaller operational family
consisting of:

* every prescribed baseline transition; and
* every pure deviation owned by the selected player.

The circulation branch is then player-owned by construction. In the
separator branch, the bounded potential controls arbitrary switching among
exactly the baseline and unilateral transitions available to that player.

This ownership theorem does not change the formal score orientation carried
by the Fink obstruction. In particular, it does not claim that a negatively
oriented Bellman charge becomes a profitable forward action, nor that the
sum of Bellman charges around the returned circulation is positive. Those
stronger conclusions require a separate nonnegative charge-lifting
hypothesis.
