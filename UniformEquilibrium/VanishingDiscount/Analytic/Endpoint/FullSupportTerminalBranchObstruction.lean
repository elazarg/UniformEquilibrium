# Exact obstruction in the full-support terminal branch

The one-state self-loop is the smallest full-active-support positive charged
class.  It has perfect regeneration, but its support rank cannot decrease
and its constant positive realized charge has no bounded account.  An
arbitrary full payoff-vector target also need not match the recurrent target.

Thus full support, positive aggregate charge, and regeneration do not form a
new atlas leaf by themselves.  The branch needs at least one genuinely new
input:

* a lower independent lexicographic rank coordinate;
* an explicit whole-vector target identification; or
* a realized charge with bounded cumulative sums (equivalently, a bounded
  realized account).
