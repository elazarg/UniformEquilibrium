# The attainable-endpoint correspondence, restarted branch

**Provenance.**  The target-coherent analytic child germ correspondence is
the endpoint correspondence

`𝒜_re(h', C) = { y : (0, y) ∈ closure Y_C }`

together with the exact restarted-coherence theorem: a restarted child germ
with endpoint `w` at the child entry exists *iff* `w ∈ 𝒜_re(h', C)`.  Up to
now that correspondence appeared in this repository only as a *hypothesis*:
the `ChildObligations` bundle of
`AnalyticPrescribedEndpointTailRecurrentChildBridge.lean`
carries fields `whole_vector_target` and `rank_decreases` that restate the
restarted-coherence theorem's conclusion as an assumption.

This file is the first pass at the missing *definitional* layer.  It defines
the restarted branch of the correspondence as an actual set of payoff
vectors, proves the easy facts about it, and exhibits the exact way a
`ChildObligations`-style consumer is fed from a membership statement.  It
proves no part of the restarted-coherence theorem itself.

**What is in scope.**

* `RestartedChildGerm G entry` — an analytic Bellman germ of the *same* game
  `G`, together with a designated entry state at which its endpoint is read.
* `attainableEndpoint G entry : Set (Payoff ι)` — the set of endpoint payoff
  vectors realized by restarted child germs at `entry`.
* `MemAttainableTarget` and the intro/elim lemmas.
* `AttainableTargetLabel` — two nodes carrying one common attainable target;
  its `whole_vector_target` lemma is exactly the field that
  `ChildObligations` assumes.
* `childObligationsOfAttainableTarget` — the de-smuggling constructor.

**What is explicitly out of scope.**

* The *inherited* branch (`w = T_C(0) V⁰`) needs germ morphisms —
  Bellman/row/target morphisms whose cell, quotient, harmonic, jet, and
  account data commute.  This repository has no germ morphism, so the
  inherited branch is not defined here.
* The full `iff` of Theorem B (equation (78)) needs semialgebraic curve
  selection for a *child* continuation presentation `𝔠 = (Z_c, z'₀, s_c,
  A_c, q_c, g_c, U_c, Ξ_C)`.  This repository has no child continuation
  presentation: a `RestartedChildGerm` here is a germ of the ambient game
  read at a designated state, which is the weakest faithful reading of
  "restart".  The genuine restarted-child system, with its own public
  configuration space and legacy interface `Ξ_C`, is future work.
* Consequently `attainableEndpoint` is the *unconstrained* restarted
  correspondence: it carries no face, forbidden-row, quotient, account, or
  rank constraint.  It is therefore an over-approximation of
  `𝒜_re(h', C)`, which is the honest direction for a *nonemptiness*
  statement but not for an exact characterization.

This file replaces nothing.  Nothing in
`AnalyticPrescribedEndpointTailRecurrentChildBridge` is modified; the
constructor below is built alongside it.

/-! ## Restarted child germs -/

/--
A **restarted child germ** of `G` at the designated entry state `entry`.

An `AnalyticBellmanGerm` solves the polynomial Bellman system of `G` at
*every* state simultaneously, and `AnalyticBellmanGerm.endpointValue` is a
function `G.State → Payoff ι`.  A germ therefore carries no intrinsic
starting state; the only thing a "restart at `entry`" adds is the
designation of the coordinate at which its endpoint vector is read.  This is
the lightest faithful bundling the repository supports, and it is
deliberately weaker than the correspondence's restarted child: a genuine
restarted child would be a germ of a *child continuation presentation* with
its own public configuration space and legacy interface, which does not
exist here.

/-! ## The attainable-endpoint correspondence -/

/--
The **attainable-endpoint correspondence** at `entry`: the set of payoff
vectors arising as the endpoint value of some restarted child germ.

This is the restarted branch of the correspondence `𝒜_re(h', C)`, taken
without the target constraints of the child Bellman system (see the module
docstring): no face selection, forbidden-row
condition, owner-history quotient, account status, or rank constraint is
imposed.  The inherited branch of the correspondence — targets that are
restrictions or affine images of the parent endpoint `V⁰` under a germ
morphism — is *not* defined here and is future work.

/-! ### The correspondence is cut out by the undiscounted Bellman system

No *uniform numeric* bound on attainable endpoints is available from the
current library: the only germ-value bound in the repository,
`AnalyticBellmanGerm.finkBoundAt`, is defined from the germ's own value
coordinates and is therefore not a bound in terms of the game data.  What
*is* cheap is the structural constraint: every attainable endpoint is the
`entry` coordinate of a solution of the undiscounted (discount factor `1`)
stationary Bellman system of `G`, equivalently of a polynomial Bellman
solution whose discount-complement coordinate vanishes.  This is a
Lean-level shadow of the constrained endpoint correspondence; it does *not*
establish that the constraint is proper for any particular game.

/-! ## De-smuggling `ChildObligations` -/

/--
`MemAttainableTarget G entry target` is the membership statement
`w ∈ 𝒜_re` for the restarted branch, with `w = target` and the child entry
`h'` represented by the state `entry`.

Under the exact restarted-coherence theorem this is *equivalent* to the
existence of a restarted child germ with endpoint `target` at `entry`.  Here
it is *defined* to be that existence (via `attainableEndpoint`); the content
that the correspondence adds — that the same set is cut out by the closure
of the constrained child root-value graph `Y_C` — is not formalized.

/--
**The de-smuggling datum.**  Two nodes of a recursion carry one common
target vector, and that vector is attainable as a restarted child endpoint
at `entry`.

This is the honest replacement for the bare equation
`nodeTarget child = nodeTarget parent` assumed by `ChildObligations`: the
equation is recovered (see `whole_vector_target`), but only from the strictly
stronger data that both nodes are *labelled by the same attainable target*.
The `attainable` field is what carries the correspondence's content; the two
labelling equations are the bookkeeping that the ambient recursion must
supply.

**The de-smuggling step.**  A `ChildObligations` bundle assembled from a
membership statement in the attainable-endpoint correspondence together with
the residual obligations.

Compared with the bare structure in
`AnalyticPrescribedEndpointTailRecurrentChildBridge`, the field
`whole_vector_target` is no longer assumed: it is *derived* from
`label.whole_vector_target`, whose content is that both nodes carry one
common target lying in `attainableEndpoint` at the child's ambient entry
state `(nodeEntry child).1`.

The residual fields are still assumed, and this is the point of the
construction — they are exactly what the correspondence does *not* supply:

* `parent_entry`, `child_entry` — the graph-theoretic identification of both
  node entries with the positive-charge class representative;
* `rank_decreases` — the strict rank descent, which is rank-faithfulness of
  the target-coherent correspondence and is *not* implied by endpoint
  equality: endpoint equality alone proves none of the rank, row, quotient,
  face, or account assertions;
* `legal_entry_interface` — the application-specific legal-entry evidence.

Note also that the `label` hypothesis is strictly stronger than membership
alone: membership of a single vector cannot produce an equality of two node
labels, so the two labelling equations must accompany it.
