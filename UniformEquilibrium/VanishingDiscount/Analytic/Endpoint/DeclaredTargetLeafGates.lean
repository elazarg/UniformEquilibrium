# Declared-target nodes and the leaf-facing gate data

The analytic endpoint atlas classifies a germ into an
`AnalyticEndpointAtlasLeaf` whose nonsemantic branches all name a
`*ReconstructionAt` obligation *at the germ's own endpoint value*.  The three
finite interface cores

* `Math.LinearAlgebra.OwnerLabeledFlowHolonomy` (gluing / holonomy),
* `Math.LinearAlgebra.OwnerTypedDualLifting` (owner custody / typed lifting),
* `Math.LinearAlgebra.OrientedAccountBridge` (oriented exact account bridge),

are, by construction, *game-free* finite linear algebra.  Nothing in the
repository currently connects them to an actual analytic endpoint leaf.  This
file is that connection layer, built **additively**: it edits no existing file,
restructures no existing `*ReconstructionAt` record, and touches no umbrella.

## What a declared-target node is, and what it deliberately is not

`DeclaredTargetNode` is the neutral carrier: a germ, its processed
endpoint-harmonic span, a public entry state, and a **declared** target payoff
vector `w`.  It carries

* no identification of `w` with `germ.endpointValue entry`,
* no implementability claim for `w`,
* no adaptive certificate,
* no uniform-payoff assumption,
* no public-lottery assumption.

The identification `w = germ.endpointValue entry` is available as the *named
predicate* `DeclaredTargetNode.IsEndpointDeclared` and as the *constructor*
`DeclaredTargetNode.ofEndpoint`; it is a theorem in special cases and never a
field.  `PureExternalityCycleGates.exists_not_isEndpointDeclared` exhibits a
concrete node of the pure-externality cycle at which it **fails**, so the
absence of the coercion is machine-checked and not merely a naming
convention.

## The extraction, honestly

The germ API (`AnalyticBellmanGerm`, `EndpointHarmonicJetSpan`,
`endpointValue`, `endpointFinkPoint`) does **not by itself** package a tagged
owner-labeled row system in the leaf-gate format, and it does not produce
"genuine unilateral Bellman rows of player `i` in a legal public response
context".  This foundational file therefore keeps `NodeFlowRows` neutral.
The downstream module `AnalyticEndpointBellmanRowCompiler` canonically
packages **all actual endpoint owned pure deviations** from the raw analytic
obstruction data.  It deliberately does not add the missing legal-public-
response interpretation.

Therefore `NodeFlowRows` takes the row system as a **component** and ties it to
the node by the coherence that is checkable today:

1. *Vertex coherence.*  Vertices are literally `G.State`; the row source map
   is `src : Row → G.State`.
2. *Owner coherence.*  Row labels are literally the player type `ι`.
3. *Stochasticity.*  `IsStochastic transition` is a field.
4. *Entry coherence.*  `entry_isSource` requires some row to be sourced at the
   node's entry state.  It is a real constraint: an empty row system fails it.
5. *Target-relative charge, definitionally.*  The record carries a gross row
   gain, and `NodeFlowRows.charge` is **defined** as
   `grossGain r - node.target (ownerOf r)`.  The charge therefore cannot drift
   away from the declared target; changing `w` changes every gate verdict
   through this one definition.
6. *Endpoint-kernel coherence, as a refutable predicate.*
   `NodeFlowRows.IsEndpointKernelTagged` says that the row transition weights
   reproduce the germ's endpoint **pure-deviation state kernels**
   `G.finkPureDeviationStateKernel germ.endpointFinkPoint` in exactly the
   pairing form `∑ v, P r v * H v` that `IsAccountPotential` consumes.  This
   one is genuinely germ-derived; it is a `Prop`, not a field, so it stays
   assumable *and* refutable (`selfLoopRows_not_isEndpointKernelTagged`).

What is **not required by this neutral record** is that `grossGain r` came
from a genuine unilateral deviation row.  The manual
`PureExternalityCycleHolonomy.rowCharge` instantiation still reads it off the
payoff table by hand.  `AnalyticEndpointBellmanRowCompiler` closes precisely
that actual-data gap for the canonical all-state/all-owner/all-action endpoint
row family, while leaving public-response legality and recursive-child
realization as separate obligations.

For the custody core the analogous coherence is sharper: `NodeCustodyGate`
fixes the boundary-target index type of the `TypedCell` to be `ι` itself, so
the cell's target coordinates *are* the payoff coordinates of the declared
target, and the field `target_memFull` checks that the declared target is a
feasible point of the full typed system.  That single field is exactly the
feasibility hypothesis `hasTypedLift_iff_validOnVisible_of_full` needs, so the
Farkas adapter at a node is unconditional.

## Gate records and adapters

Three additive records, each carrying its node and its finite-core system:

* `NodeGluingGate` — flow rows; verdict `Glues := ZeroHolonomy`.  Adapter
  `glues_iff_hasAccountPotential` is one application of
  `zeroHolonomy_iff_exists_accountPotential`.
* `NodeAccountBridgeGate` — a gluing gate refined by a strictly positive
  circulation witness; verdict `Bridges := ∃ H, IsExactBridge`.  Adapter
  `bridges_iff_neutralGlues` is unconditional *on this record*, because the
  witness discharges `HasFullSupportCirculation`.  The record can fail to
  exist — that is the `ParallelRows` separation, preserved as
  `noWitness_of_circulation_eq_zero`.
* `NodeCustodyGate` — a typed cell whose target coordinates are the declared
  target's; verdict `Lifts i α β := HasTypedLift`.  Adapter
  `lifts_iff_validVisible` is one application of
  `hasTypedLift_iff_validOnVisible_of_full`.

Each gate exposes a two-valued `GateVerdict` and a `pass ∨ fail` dichotomy, so
a future dispatcher can case on the verdict.  Gate failure is always
accompanied by a *witness type* (`FarkasWitness`, `VisibleEscape`), so the
falsifier zoo of the three cores survives the transport to nodes.

## Vacuity probes

Every new `Prop` and structure is probed.

* `DeclaredTargetNode` is inhabited for every germ and every `w`
  (`declare`); that is the point of neutrality.  `IsEndpointDeclared` is not
  automatic (`exists_not_isEndpointDeclared`).
* `NodeFlowRows` is inhabited at every node by `selfLoopRows`, and the
  resulting gluing gate **passes** when the declared target coordinate is
  nonnegative and **fails** when it is negative — so neither verdict is
  vacuous.
* `IsEndpointKernelTagged` is refuted by `selfLoopRows` on the
  pure-externality cycle, and satisfied by `cycleRows` there.
* `NodeCustodyGate` is inhabited by `trivialCustodyGate`, whose typed cell has
  no rows at all; it lifts `0` at bound `0` and lifts **no** nonzero
  functional at any bound.

## Instantiation

`PureExternalityCycleGates` builds the records on the two explicit germs of
`PureExternalityCycleGerm`, with the tagged rows of
`PureExternalityCycleHolonomy`.  Both nodes are endpoint-declared, and the
gates separate:

* at `prescribedGerm` with declared target `(0, 0)` the gluing gate **fails**,
  no account potential exists, and no exact bridge exists — even though the
  full-support witness is present;
* at `oneGerm` with declared target `(1, 1)` the charge is identically `0`,
  the gluing gate **passes**, and an exact bridge exists.

So the gate verdict is not a function of `IsEndpointDeclared`: both nodes
declare their germ's endpoint value, and they land on opposite sides.

/-! ### Capstone -/

/-- **Capstone: the leaf-facing gate data of the pure-externality cycle.**

Two declared-target nodes over the same game, both *endpoint-declared*, carry
the same tagged owner-labeled row system and land on opposite sides of every
flow gate; a third node shows the declared target is not coerced from the
endpoint value; and the custody gate reproduces the cross-owner-cancellation
falsifier at a node while still passing on an owned coordinate.

Read together with `PureExternalityCycleHolonomy.routeZero_acceptance` — which
certifies that the prescribed profile *does* deliver `(0, 0)` as a uniform
equilibrium payoff — this says exactly that a failed gate is not an
obstruction to equilibrium.  The gates are leaf data, not verdicts on the
game. -/
