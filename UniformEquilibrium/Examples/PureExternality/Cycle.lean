# The two-state pure-externality cycle

The two-player, two-state stochastic game in which **every action is a pure
externality**: a player's own stage payoff never depends on that player's own
action, only on the opponent's.

```text
states            x  ⟶  y  ⟶  x  ⟶ ⋯          (every action switches the state)

at x   player 1 controls:   a = 0 ↦ (1, -1)     a = 1 ↦ (1, 1)
at y   player 2 controls:   b = 0 ↦ (-1, 1)     b = 1 ↦ (1, 1)
```

Transitions ignore all actions, so the state path is the deterministic
alternation `x, y, x, y, …`.  At `x` player 1's own payoff is `1` under both of
their actions; at `y` player 2's own payoff is `1` under both of theirs.  The
controller's action moves only the *other* player's payoff.  The prescribed
profile plays action `0` at both states.

## Provenance

This is the counterexample game of Part E (§11–§13) of an untracked local
research note on mixed-context strategic routing: a finite genuine source
datum for which all four routing strategies of the mixed-context
strategic-routing theorem fail.  **This file is only the raw layer** — the game
itself and its direct equilibrium facts.  The four-route no-go theorems need
the routing interfaces (schedulers, owner purification, common accounts,
strict children) and are deliberately not stated here.

## Encoding

Players and states are both `Bool`.  Player `false` is player 1, player `true`
is player 2; state `x = false`, state `y = true`.  The encoding is chosen so
that **state `s` is the state controlled by player `s`**, which turns the
payoff table into the single formula `stagePayoffOf`:  at state `s` under
controller action `b`, player `who` receives `1` if `who = s`, and otherwise
`1` if `b` and `-1` if `¬ b`.

## Main definitions

* `PureExternalityCycle.game` — the stochastic game
* `PureExternalityCycle.statePath` — the deterministic state alternation
* `PureExternalityCycle.constProfile` — the profile playing a fixed action
  after every history; `constProfile false` is the prescribed profile

## Main results

* `PureExternalityCycle.stagePayoff_indep_own_action` — the pure-externality
  property: a player's stage payoff is invariant under changing their own
  action
* `PureExternalityCycle.finiteAveragePayoff_of_opponents_const` — **payoff
  invariance**: against opponents that always play a fixed action, a player's
  finite-horizon average payoff is a closed-form constant, independent of that
  player's own (arbitrary, history-dependent) behavior strategy
* `PureExternalityCycle.finiteAveragePayoff_update_constProfile` — the
  concrete corollary: no unilateral deviation changes the deviator's average
  payoff at all
* `PureExternalityCycle.isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_zero_x` — the capstone: the
  prescribed profile witnesses the uniform equilibrium payoff `(0, 0)` from
  state `x`
* `PureExternalityCycle.isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_one_x` — the constant-`1`
  profile witnesses the uniform equilibrium payoff `(1, 1)` from `x`, so the
  game has several uniform equilibrium payoffs
