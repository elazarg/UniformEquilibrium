# The Big Match: the positive (Blackwell–Ferguson) side of the uniform value

`BigMatchNoMarkov.lean` shows that no calendar-time × state Markov profile can
witness the classical Big Match uniform value `(1/2, -1/2)`: the maximizer's
`ε`-optimal response has to be genuinely history-dependent.  This file
constructs such a history-dependent witness, following Blackwell–Ferguson
(1968), and proves the Big Match's uniform equilibrium payoff exists at the
live state: **`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_live`**, the capstone theorem,
is sorry-free.

## The maximizer's history-dependent strategy

At every live stage, define the *net excess* `k` of the minimizer's past
Right plays over Left plays (`netRightExcess`).  The Blackwell–Ferguson
strategy with parameter `N` stops with probability `1 / D ^ 2`, where
`D = max (k + N + 1) 1` (`bfDenom`) is the excess shifted by `N` and clamped
to stay at least `1`.  This is `blackwellFergusonStrategy`.

## The minimizer's stationary strategy and the easy direction

The minimizer's uniform stationary strategy `uniformMinimizerStrategy` plays
Left/Right with probability `1/2` after every history.  Against it, *every*
maximizer strategy earns finite-average payoff *exactly* `1/2`, at every
positive horizon (`finiteAveragePayoff_eq_half_of_uniformMinimizer`): the
off-diagonal reward is symmetric, and a uniform minimizer keeps the
probabilities of ever absorbing at `.one` versus `.zero` exactly equal at
every stage, so the two absorption events cancel in expectation.  This is the
content of `expectedStateValue_oneIndicator_eq_zeroIndicator` and its
corollary `expectedStagePayoff_eq_half_of_uniformMinimizer`.  Together these
give the *deviation cap* for the maximizer's half of a prospective uniform
equilibrium at `(1/2, -1/2)`, and (after inverting via zero-sumness) they are
also exactly what the minimizer would need from *its* opponent to cap the
maximizer from below at `1/2 - δ`: that lower bound is the hard direction.

## The hard (Blackwell–Ferguson) estimate, in three stages

* **Stage 3a–3b** (deterministic minimizer schedules): `blackwellFergusonStrategy
  N` earns at least `1/2 - O(1/N)` against every fixed calendar schedule
  `d : ℕ → Bool`.  Stage 3a (`histDist_eq_bfSeqProfile`) collapses the
  history-dependent excess to the deterministic `bfExcess d t` along every
  reachable branch, reusing `BigMatch.lean`'s `TimeStateMixedProfile` API;
  Stage 3b tracks the exact-identity potential `bfPotential D := (D - 1)/(2D)`
  against the excess denominator (`bfM_le_succ` through `bfFiniteAverage_ge`,
  culminating in `bfSeq_eventually_ge_half`).
* **Stage 3c** (arbitrary minimizer deviations, `bf_dev_eventually_ge_half`):
  lifts Stage 3b from schedules to *every* minimizer behavior strategy `dev`,
  via a *history-level* submartingale `bfX`/`bfXExpect` (Piece 2,
  `bfXExpect_le_succ`/`bfXExpect_ge_bfPotential`, the direct history-level
  analogue of `bfM_le_succ`), a per-stage payoff bound against the mixed
  minimizer action (Piece 3, `stageEUAt_bfDevProfile_ge`/
  `expectedStagePayoff_bfDevProfile_ge`), and two summation bounds over the
  horizon (Piece 4: `sum_bfLiveDeltaExpect_ge`, a *pathwise* support-level
  induction on the raw stage record reusing
  `netRightExcess_ge_of_live_of_mem_support`; `sum_bfLivePExpect_le_one`, a
  telescoping identity on the live-mass process).
* **Stage 4** (`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_live`): assembles Stage 2's
  exact on-path/maximizer-deviation caps and Stage 3c's minimizer-deviation
  cap (via the zero-sum identity `finiteAveragePayoff_minimizer`) through
  `isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_deviation_caps`.

Two earlier obstructions are worth recording for context (both are genuine
mathematical facts about this problem, not proof-search failures, and neither
blocks the route actually taken above): no *pointwise*, everywhere-sure
Bellman telescope can support a strictly positive rate across the `.zero`
self-loop, and no *bounded, history-independent* potential against a flat
target `v` can either (`.zero`-absorbed mass never shrinks in Cesàro average).
Stage 3c's per-stage bound instead carries its own floor `bfPotential (N+1)`
rather than a flat target, sidestepping both obstructions. An *aggregate*
(expectation-level, non-pathwise) Abel-summation route for Piece 4(i) was
also tried and fails, since liveness and the excess step are correlated
across the different histories present at a fixed stage; Piece 4(i)'s
*pathwise* per-history argument (mask by the prefix's own liveness, telescope
via `netRightExcess_snoc`, expectations only at the end) avoids this
entirely and needs no `restrictHist`/Abel summation at all — only a direct
structural induction on the horizon, mirroring
`netRightExcess_ge_of_live_of_mem_support`'s own proof.

/-! ## Stage 3a: collapsing a deterministic minimizer schedule to a
`TimeStateMixedProfile`

Against `blackwellFergusonStrategy N`, the live histories at any stage carry
no maximizer-side information: on any live branch the maximizer's own past
actions have all been `false` (continue), since a single `true` (stop) would
have left `.live` for good.  So when the minimizer plays a *fixed calendar
schedule* `d : ℕ → Bool` (`BigMatchMarkov.minimizerSchedule d`), the combined
profile's induced play is *exactly* the play of the simple, state/time-only
`TimeStateMixedProfile` `bfSeqProfile N d`: the excess `netRightExcess h`
appearing in `blackwellFergusonStrategy`'s stopping probability collapses,
along every reachable history, to the deterministic `bfExcess d t`.  This
lets every downstream computation reuse `BigMatch.lean`'s already-proved
`TimeStateMixedProfile` machinery (`stateLiveProbability_eq_prod`,
`finiteAveragePayoff_maximizer`, etc.) instead of re-deriving it. -/

/-! ## Stage 3b: the deterministic-sequence estimate (exact-identity route)

The Blackwell–Ferguson potential `bfPotential D := (D - 1) / (2 D)` and the
excess-denominator recursion `bfDenom` support an *exact* telescoping
identity (no per-step slack) away from the `D = 1` boundary, so the
quantity `bfM := stateOneProbability + stateLiveProbability * bfPotential`
is monotone nondecreasing along every schedule — a pure real-algebra fact,
verified below stage by stage. -/

/-! ## Stage 3c: toward general minimizer deviations

`bfDevProfile N dev` pairs `blackwellFergusonStrategy N` for the maximizer
with an *arbitrary* minimizer behavior strategy `dev` (as opposed to a fixed
calendar schedule `minimizerSchedule d`).  The excess bound
`bfExcess_ge_of_stateLiveProbability_pos` generalizes to this setting
essentially verbatim, since it only uses that `blackwellFergusonStrategy`'s
own stopping probability is forced to `1` once the excess denominator
clamps to `1` (a fact about the maximizer's own coin, independent of what
the minimizer does). -/

`stageEUAt_bfDevProfile_ge` is the history-level, mixed-action generalization
of Stage 3b's `bfStagePayoff_ge`: at a live history, the maximizer's own coin
(`blackwellFergusonStrategy`) and the minimizer's mixed action `dev t h`
combine into an expected stage reward `p*(1-q) + (1-p)*q` (the off-diagonal
Big Match reward), which dominates `bfX N h + (q - 1/2) - p` since `bfX N h =
φ(D) < 1/2` and `p, q ≥ 0` absorb the rest — the same "drop the nonnegative
correction terms" step as `bfStagePayoff_ge`, now against a mixed `q` instead
of a pure `d t`. -/

Two bounds needed to sum Piece 3's per-stage inequality over a horizon:
`sum_bfLiveDeltaExpect_ge` (part (i)) and `sum_bfLivePExpect_le_one` (part
(ii)). Both avoid `restrictHist` entirely: (i) is proved by a *pathwise*
support-level induction on the raw stage record (`bfDeltaSum`), reusing
`netRightExcess_ge_of_live_of_mem_support`, and then lifted to the
expectation level by the *same* one-step `histDist_succ` unfolding used for
`bfLiveDeltaExpect_eq`; (ii) is proved by recognizing `bfLivePExpect` as the
one-step drop in live probability, telescoping via
`Math.sum_range_sub_succ`. -/

/-! ### Part (i): the signed-excess sum -/

/-- The raw, unconditional analogue of `netRightExcess`, masked by liveness of

live and `netRightExcess_ge_of_live_of_mem_support` bounds it, dropping by at

The Big Match is `IsZeroSumBoolGame` at every state and joint action
(`payoff_minimizer`); the maximizer's Blackwell–Ferguson strategy is a
one-sided guarantee securing `1/2` (Stage 3c,
`bf_dev_eventually_ge_half_via_certificate`, exactly); the minimizer's
uniform stationary strategy is a one-sided guarantee securing `-1/2`
(Stage 2, `finiteAveragePayoff_eq_half_of_uniformMinimizer`, an *exact*
equality against every maximizer completion — no submartingale needed).
Feeding both into
`AdaptiveCertificate.lean`'s `isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_isZeroSumBoolGame_of_oneSidedGuarantees`

certificates + invoke the generic wrapper". -/

/-! ## Superseded route-analysis notes (kept out of the module docstring)

Earlier passes on this file explored, and abandoned, two other routes before
landing on the one summarized in the module docstring above: (route (a)) a
mixture-over-deterministic-schedules identity built from scratch against a
`liveHistOf`/`wPMF` construction, matching Kuhn's theorem but requiring a
nontrivial disintegration argument to formalize directly; and (route (b), in
an early form) an *aggregate* Abel-summation attempt for what became Piece
4(i), which does not work for the reason recorded in the module docstring
(liveness and the excess step are correlated across histories at a fixed
stage). Both were superseded by the pathwise argument that Piece 4(i) above
actually uses. `GameTheory.Languages.Kuhn.BehavioralToMixedCore` (route (c))
was also inspected as a possible shortcut and set aside: instantiating it
for this game's history-dependent stopping rule would require re-encoding
`game.Hist t` as `List`-based traces, at least as much bridging work as the
direct route. None of this is needed to understand the (complete, sorry-free)
proof above; it is kept only as a historical note against re-exploration.
