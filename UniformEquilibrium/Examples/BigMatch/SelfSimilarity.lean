# The exact live-cycle core of Big Match self-similarity

This file formalizes the elementary structural part of the Big Match
self-similarity argument.  In the repository's Boolean convention, player `false` is the maximizer,
whose actions are `false = Continue` and `true = Stop`; player `true` is the
minimizer, whose actions are `false = Left` and `true = Right`.

The explicit history below plays `(Continue, Left)` and then
`(Continue, Right)`.  Both transitions remain live, its maximizer rewards are
`0` and `1` in that order, and its complete two-player payoff is exactly twice
the target `(1/2, -1/2)`.  Its target debt is therefore zero, and restarting
from its endpoint is literally restarting from the original live state.

This is only the self-similarity calculation.  It does **not** formalize or
assume the external theorem that every finite public controller fails to
secure the Big Match target, and hence proves no universal routing-resistance
or atlas-rank statement.
