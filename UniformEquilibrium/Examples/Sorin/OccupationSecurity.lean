# Security strategies for Sorin's absorbing game

This file isolates the two unilateral-security ingredients used by Sorin's
stopping argument.  The first one, proved below, is elementary but strategically
important: player 2 can secure `2 / 3` at every positive finite horizon by
playing `Left` with probability `1 / 3` at every history.  The proof is against
an arbitrary history-dependent behavioral strategy of player 1.

The exact finite-horizon identity is stronger than the asymptotic guarantee
needed by the occupation-separation argument.  It is stated separately so that
the later deterministic live-history splice can consume it without importing
any target-payoff or equilibrium hypotheses.
