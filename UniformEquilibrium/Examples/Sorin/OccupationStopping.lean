# Survival accounting for Sorin's occupation-separation argument

This module formalizes the finite-probability backbone of Sorin's stopping
proof.  The live-state probability is antitone, converges to its infimum, and
the sum of the two expected stage payoffs is at most `2` minus the next
live-state probability.  These facts avoid constructing an infinite-play
measure: the later stopping estimate can work entirely with finite public
history laws and the real limit of the survival sequence.

/-! ## Sorin's quantitative stopping estimate -/

/-- **Quantitative stopping theorem.**  Every fixed uniform positive-`epsilon`
equilibrium profile has infinite-survival mass at most `14 * epsilon`.

The constants follow Sorin's slack calculation.  We use
`eta = zeta = 1/500`, which leaves the sum of the two conditional tail gains
strictly above `2 r_N / 13`; one player therefore gains more than `r_N / 13`.
A suffix longer than `13 N` has weight above `13 / 14`, producing a root gain
above `r_N / 14`. -/
