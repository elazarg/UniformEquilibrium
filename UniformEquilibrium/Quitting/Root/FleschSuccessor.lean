# The Flesch successor graph for quitting games

For an owner `i`, a different player `j` can be the next active singleton
quitter on a sequentially perfect Flesch absorption path only when the two
cross-payoff comparisons have opposite signs relative to the players' own
singleton payoffs:

* player `i` strictly loses when `j` quits rather than `i`;
* player `j` strictly gains when `i` quits rather than `j`.

This is the normalization-independent form of the graph in
Ashkenazi-Golan--Krasikov--Rainer--Solan.  When every own-singleton payoff is
normalized to zero it becomes

`r_i({j}) < 0 < r_j({i})`

with the repository convention that
`quittingSoloReward reward quitter recipient = r_recipient({quitter})`.

The strict cross-sign rule is asymmetric, so the graph has neither loops nor
directed two-cycles.  The final theorem extracts an edge from two consecutive
positive singleton arcs under the paper's singleton genericity condition.
