# Regression guards for the essential APS operator

The undiscounted operator admits degenerate `mass = 0` decompositions. Hence a
viable active-face point can be invariant without describing any absorption.
This file records the mechanism in a table-independent form: if a singleton
set `{value}` self-generates and the owner's singleton vector is not `value`,
every self-loop decomposition has mass exactly zero.

This is the formal regression behind the warning that invariant sets are not,
without an absorption-progress hypothesis, executable singleton-flow paths.
