# Block contraction along essential-APS successor paths

This module composes the compact `nu`-lemma with the bounded-drift opponent
mass estimate.

For every possible starting owner, compact active-face separation gives a
positive total-mass constant on its successor orbit. There are only finitely
many owners, so the minimum of these constants is still positive and works at
every time shift of one infinite path. The strict Flesch cross-gain also has a
positive finite minimum. Concatenating enough `nu`-windows then makes the
playerwise opponent-mass lower bound positive, and the singleton-root product
estimate yields a uniform block contraction factor `rho < 1`.
