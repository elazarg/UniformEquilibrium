# Opponent mass forced by bounded essential-APS paths

A total absorption-mass lower bound is not by itself a playerwise survival
bound: in an arbitrary owner-labelled path all mass could be assigned to one
owner. Along an active Flesch path this concentration is impossible.

Fix a player `who` and inspect the payoff coordinate of `successor who`.
Whenever `who` owns the current edge, activity at the next vertex turns the
singleton arc equation into a strictly positive displacement of that fixed
coordinate. Every edge owned by somebody else can compensate by at most
`2 * bound` times its mass. Boundedness of the two endpoint values therefore
gives

`gap * ownMass ≤ 2 * bound + 2 * bound * opponentMass`.

Combining this inequality with a lower bound on total mass yields a positive
lower bound on the mass contributed by opponents of every player once enough
windows are concatenated. This is the deterministic bridge from the compact
APS `nu`-lemma to opponent-survival contraction.
