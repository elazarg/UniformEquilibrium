# Uniform upper bounds on terminal-free essential-APS hazards

A proper APS witness only states `p < 1` pointwise.  For nonperiodic mesh
subdivision one needs one ceiling `pStar < 1` along the whole infinite run.
Compactness and terminal-freeness provide it.

For an owner `i`, measure the distance from the singleton root `R_i` by the
sum of the coordinatewise absolute gaps.  This continuous function is
strictly positive on a terminal-free greatest fiber: a zero is exactly
`R_i`, and greatest-family membership supplies viability, making that point a
terminal APS endpoint.  Compactness gives a positive minimum, and finiteness
of the player set gives one minimum for all owners.

Along an arc `v = p R_i + (1-p) w`, the root gap of `v` is at most
`(1-p)` times a common bound on the root gap of `w`.  The positive compact
minimum therefore forces `1-p` uniformly positive.
