# Multivalued execution for segment-closed essential APS families

Algebraic essential-APS invariance uses a convex hull and does not by itself
select a chronological continuation. This file states the exact additional
hypothesis needed for multivalued execution: every family point has a terminal
decomposition or one singleton segment whose next owner remains in a supplied
carrier.

The carrier is an arbitrary set of owners. No finiteness, strong connectivity,
or uniqueness of the live successor is used. Under segment closure, dependent
choice produces either a finite charged path to a terminal point or an
infinite exact APS run. The recurrent branch also retains the selected Flesch
successor at every date.
