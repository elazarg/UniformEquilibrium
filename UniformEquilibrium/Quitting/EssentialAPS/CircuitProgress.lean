# Finite-path progress from essential APS

The convex fixed-point layer reduces a unique-successor APS step to three
possibilities: terminal absorption, zero-mass propagation into the successor
fiber, or a proper segment with mass in `(0,1)`.

This file iterates that local trichotomy over a finite successor path.  If no
terminal or proper step occurs in the first `horizon` edges, the same payoff
belongs to every greatest-family fiber visited by the path and therefore lies
on every corresponding active hyperplane.  Consequently, excluding the
common active face on the carrier forces progress in a bounded window.

This is the finite combinatorial core of the simple-circuit argument: a chain
of zero-mass APS edges can persist only by carrying one payoff unchanged
through all active faces on the circuit.  Compactness is still needed to turn
pointwise bounded-window progress into a uniform positive lower bound on the
sum of masses, but the zero-mass obstruction itself is now eliminated by an
exact theorem rather than an informal argument.
