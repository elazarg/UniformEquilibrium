# Total finite-path progress for essential APS

The first finite-path progress theorem assumes every displayed successor fiber
is nonempty.  That hypothesis is convenient for applying the convex-join
representation directly, but it is not logically necessary.

At a unique live successor, an empty displayed successor fiber collapses the
full prefix to the convex hull of a singleton.  Hence every greatest-family
point at the current owner is the viable solo endpoint and is terminal.
Combining this empty-fiber case with the nonempty convex-fiber trichotomy yields
a total local recursion and removes all nonemptiness assumptions from the
finite path and active-face exclusion theorems.

/-- **Total local progress at a unique live successor.**  Other exact graph
successors may exist, but their greatest-family fibers must be empty.  No
nonemptiness hypothesis is needed: an empty displayed fiber forces the current
point to be terminal. -/
