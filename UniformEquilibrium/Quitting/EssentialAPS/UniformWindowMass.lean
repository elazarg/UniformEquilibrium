# Uniform positive absorption mass on finite essential-APS windows

The qualitative circuit-progress theorem says that a chain of zero-mass
unique-successor APS steps can persist only when one unchanged payoff lies on
every active hyperplane in the window.  Compactness upgrades this pointwise
statement to a quantitative one.

For a payoff `current`, define its finite active-face gap as the sum of the
absolute discrepancies from all active hyperplanes visited in the window.  On
a compact set avoiding their common intersection, this continuous gap has a
strictly positive minimum `delta`.

Along a singleton-flow arc

`value t = p_t * root_t + (1-p_t) * value (t+1)`,

the displacement in one step is at most `2 * bound * p_t` when roots and path
values are uniformly bounded by `bound`.  Telescoping therefore controls every
active-face gap of `value 0` by the cumulative mass `sum p_t`.  Combining the
telescoping estimate with the compact positive minimum produces one constant
`nu > 0` which works for every admissible arc path.

This is the quantitative `nu`-lemma used in the simple-circuit argument: every
window carries uniformly positive total absorption mass.  It is stated for the
unique-successor singleton-flow stratum and does not assert the general
quitting-game existence theorem.
