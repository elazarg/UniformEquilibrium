# Compact greatest essential-APS families with unique live successors

Graph-theoretic uniqueness is stronger than the closure bootstrap needs.  The
one-fiber formula only requires that every competing exact successor have an
empty continuation fiber.  Empty fibers remain empty after coordinatewise
closure, so the bootstrap proving closedness and compactness of the greatest
APS family extends unchanged to unique live successors.
