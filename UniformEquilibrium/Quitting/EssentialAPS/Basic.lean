# Essential APS certificates for the singleton-flow stratum

This file formalizes the algebraic part of the essential APS construction for
undiscounted quitting games. The operator is baseline invariant: instead of
normalizing every own-singleton payoff to zero, all continuation values are
required to dominate

`quittingSoloBaseline reward who = r_who({who})`.

There are two related prefix notions, and the distinction is load-bearing for
nonconvex continuation sets.

* `quittingEssentialAPSPrefix` is the full algebraic APS prefix
  `co ({R_owner} ∪ E)` intersected with the active face and the viability
  region. Thus it convexifies arbitrary continuation sets exactly as stated by
  the convex-hull display in the paper.
* `quittingSegmentEssentialAPSPrefix` records one concrete path segment
  `current = p R_owner + (1-p) next` with `next ∈ E`.

The segment prefix is always contained in the full prefix, but the reverse
inclusion need not hold when `E` is nonconvex. The owner-indexed essential APS
operator and its greatest fixed family use the full convex-hull prefix.
Executable finite-cycle certificates use the stronger segment relation and
are then embedded into the algebraic operator.

The proper segment prefix further requires `p ∈ (0,1)`. The zero-mass lemmas
record the exact false-progress pathology: a pinned continuation can reproduce
itself with `p = 0`, so algebraic fixed-point membership alone is not an
executable absorption path.
