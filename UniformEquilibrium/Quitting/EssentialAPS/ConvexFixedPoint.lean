# Convexity and local progress in essential-APS fixed families

The terminal disjunct in an essential-APS owner step is set-theoretically
redundant: every viable solo endpoint already belongs to the full prefix,
independently of the continuation set.  Since the full prefix is an
intersection of convex conditions around a convex hull, every owner-step image
is convex even when the raw union of successor fibers is not.

This observation propagates through the carrier-restricted fixed-point
construction.  If each carrier fiber is convex, then every fiber of the
greatest essential-APS family inside that carrier is convex.  Consequently,
at an owner with a unique live exact Flesch successor, the successor union is
one convex fixed-point fiber and the convex progress extraction theorem
applies.  A current value then has exactly three possibilities:

* it is the viable solo terminal endpoint;
* it is already in the successor fiber, the zero-mass endpoint case; or
* it has a proper one-continuation segment witness with mass in `(0,1)`.

Here “unique live” is weaker than graph-theoretic uniqueness: other exact
successors may exist, provided their continuation fibers are empty.  Thus the
remaining obstruction on functional live-successor regions is localized to
zero-mass endpoint propagation, not convexification.
