# Infinite essential-APS runs with opponent contraction

This file packages the two independent constructions:

1. terminal-free unique-live APS recursion produces one coherent infinite run;
2. compact active-face separation and bounded Flesch drift give that run a
   uniform opponent block-contraction certificate.

The singleton roots implementing the run also satisfy the exact prescribed
Bellman equations.  Thus the remaining input for the existing infinite-path
equilibrium compiler is local deviation control, not path existence or tail
contraction.

/-- **Infinite APS path with exact Bellman transport and uniform opponent
contraction.**  Under terminal-freeness, compact unique-live successor fibers,
and finite-window active-face avoidance, every initial greatest-family point
admits one coherent infinite executable run whose singleton-root implementation
has a block-contraction factor strictly below one. -/
