# Closed-class occupation cancellation is not chronological execution

This semantic fence has two disjoint closed recurrent classes. A half-half
invariant occupation has zero signed charge because the two classes carry
opposite signs. Every chronological execution beginning in the positive class
remains there, and its prefix charge is its length.

Thus an aggregate stationary cancellation does not select, or substitute for,
one executable path. The charged-path formulation also records the same
positive prefix growth in the generic execution API.
