# Constructing coherent infinite essential-APS runs

The finite-run theorem constructs a run for every requested horizon, but those
runs need not be definitionally compatible as the horizon varies.  When no
point of the visited greatest-family fibers is terminal, the total local
trichotomy supplies a continuation at every stage.  Classical dependent choice
therefore produces one coherent infinite sequence of values and masses.

The resulting run stays inside the greatest APS family, uses masses in
`[0,1)`, and satisfies the exact singleton-arc equation at every stage.  It is
therefore the path object consumed by the opponent-contraction theorem.
