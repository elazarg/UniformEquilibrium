# Compact greatest essential-APS families on unique-successor graphs

The essential-APS greatest family is constructed as a Tarski union of
subinvariant families, so compactness does not follow formally from its
definition.  On a unique-successor graph, however, the operator has a closed
one-fiber form.  This file proves a closure bootstrap:

1. a convex join of one root with a compact payoff set is compact;
2. hence a full APS prefix over a compact convex continuation fiber is closed;
3. the coordinatewise closure of the greatest family is again subinvariant;
4. maximality then forces the greatest family to equal its closure.

Therefore compact convex carriers produce compact greatest-family fibers when
every owner has a displayed unique Flesch successor.  This is the topological
input needed to upgrade bounded-window pointwise progress to a uniform positive
mass bound by an extreme-value argument.
