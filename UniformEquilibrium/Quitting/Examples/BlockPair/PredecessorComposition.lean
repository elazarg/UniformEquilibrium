# Validity and composition of block-pair predecessor charts

This file connects the explicit charts to the game-facing one-phase
predecessor correspondence.  It separates the algebraic core (inactive
hazards are zero, active players are indifferent, and the displayed value is
the terminal-table predecessor value) from the open chamber inequalities
checked by exact interval certificates.

The final section fixes composition orientation.  A word listed in temporal
order is folded from the right, so its last-phase chart acts first.  A fixed
point of that return therefore decodes to a cyclic chain of valid one-phase
predecessor links.
