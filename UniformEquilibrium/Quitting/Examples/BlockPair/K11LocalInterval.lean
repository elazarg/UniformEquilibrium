# Phase-local sparse interval evaluation for the block-pair K11 system

Every one-phase formula depends on at most four hazards (in fact at most
three on the public support).  This evaluator differentiates those formulas
in four local coordinates, caches the sixteen mask probabilities, and only
then lifts the five phase summaries into the 31-dimensional global gradient.
