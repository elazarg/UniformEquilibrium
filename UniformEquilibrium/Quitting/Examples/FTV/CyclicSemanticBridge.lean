# Semantic and finite-packet bridges for the concrete FTV controller

This module connects two previously independent facts about the prescribed
three-cycle:

* the ten-node response architecture is semantically credible from every one
  of its configurations, on the total split domain;
* its three live mixing rows, promises, and cyclic successor are exactly the
  data of `FTVCyclicMinimality.standardPacket`.

The first statement specializes the supplied-architecture semantic
characterization.  The second exposes the concrete `(Q1)--(Q5)` obligations
already carried by `ExactCyclicPacket`.  No converse from arbitrary public
response semantics to an arbitrary-`K` cyclic packet is claimed: such a
statement first needs an explicit arbitrary-`K` controller constructor and a
declared reachability/reduction convention.
