# The published `ε`-perturbation excludes period-one and period-three cycles

The `ε`-bonus perturbation (`ε > 0`) of the
Flesch--Thuijsman--Vrieze three-player table already formalized in
`FTVCyclicAdmissibleCycle.lean`,

`r({1}) = (1, 3, 0)`, `r({1,2}) = (1+ε, 0, 1)`,
`r({2}) = (0, 1, 3)`, `r({2,3}) = (1, 1+ε, 0)`,
`r({3}) = (3, 0, 1)`, `r({1,3}) = (0, 1, 1+ε)`,
`r({1,2,3}) = (0, 0, 0)`,

has positive solo values (so it is not zero-solo) and admits no admissible
absorbing quitting cycle at period one or at period three.  This file proves
those two facts, reusing the unperturbed table's machinery rather than
rebuilding it.

## What this does not do

It does **not** show the weight admits no cycle at *any* period; that is the
published Theorem 2.1 (Solan 2001) in its bounded form, and it is
unformalized here.  Nothing below states or implies it.

## Scope of the two period-one results

Two period-one theorems are proved.  `not_quittingSoloQuitterCriterion_ftvRewardEps`
is the literal fence recorded in `FRONTIER.md` and in the hand computation:
the repository's own name for the classical affine no-join condition,
`QuittingSoloQuitterCriterion`, fails at every coordinate and every rate.

The stronger `not_isQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock_of_isolated` goes past that
named sufficient condition to the actual carrier predicate
`IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` itself: **no period-one block whose single
row isolates one coordinate as the sole possible quitter is admissible**, for
*every* choice of owner, absorbing hazard, and terminal vector -- not merely
for the specific rate-`p` row family the no-join condition tests.  It does
**not** cover period-one rows at which two or three coordinates mix between
quit and continue simultaneously; the repository has no period-one Nash
machinery for that shape, so that case is open.

## Scope of the period-three result

`not_isQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock_ftvBlock_ftvRewardEps` shows that
`FTVCyclicAdmissibleCycle.ftvBlock` -- the *exact same* three-phase block data
that is an admissible cyclic continuation for the unperturbed table -- is
**not** an `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` for the `ε`-perturbed table, at
any `ε > 0`.  This is a statement about *that one block*, reproducing the
hand computation's preemption mechanism exactly: recomputing the deviation
payoff from the repository's own `quittingRootQuitPayoff`/
`quittingRootContinuePayoff` gives `½·(1+ε) + ½·1 = 1 + ε/2` against a
continuation payoff of `1`, a strictly profitable deviation of size `ε/2`.  It
is **not** a claim that every period-three block fails; other period-three
blocks for this weight are not examined here.

(`FTVCyclicAdmissibleCycle.ftvReward`) plus a bonus `ε` at coordinate `who`
exactly when the quitting coalition is `who`'s own cyclic pair
`{who, nextThree who}`.  This reproduces the published table: e.g. at
`quitters = {0,1}` the bonus fires at `who = 0` (since `{0,1} = {0,
nextThree 0}`), giving `r_0({0,1}) = 1 + ε` while `r_1({0,1})` and
`r_2({0,1})` are untouched -- exactly `r({1,2}) = (1+ε, 0, 1)` in the

/-- **The affine no-join condition fails at every coordinate, for every
non-negative rate.**  `QuittingSoloQuitterCriterion` is the repository's own
name (`QuittingSoloQuitterEquilibrium.lean`) for the classical affine
no-join condition of `FRONTIER.md`.  Tested at owner `i` against opponent
`j = prevThree i`, it reads `(1-p)·r_j({j}) + p·r_j({i,j}) ≤ r_j({i})`, i.e.
`(1-p)·1 + p·(1+ε) ≤ 0`, i.e. `1 + p·ε ≤ 0` -- false for every `p ≥ 0` once
`ε ≥ 0`.  Stated at every `i`, matching the cyclic symmetry of the hand
computation. -/

/-- **Deliverable 2, strongest form.**  No period-one block whose row
isolates a single coordinate as the sole possible quitter is an admissible
cyclic-continuation block for the perturbed weight -- for *every* owner,
*every* absorbing hazard, and *every* terminal vector, not merely against the
specific rate-`p` family the no-join criterion tests.  The value recursion
forces `terminal` to equal the owner's own solo reward (the unique fixed
point of an absorbing row,
`quittingCyclicContinuation_unique_of_absorbing_period_one`); against that
forced value, exact endpoint Nash is equivalent to
`QuittingSoloQuitterCriterion`
(`isεQuittingRootEndpointNash_soloStationaryRoot_iff`), which always fails by
`not_quittingSoloQuitterCriterion_ftvRewardEps`.

This does **not** cover period-one rows at which two or three coordinates
mix between quit and continue simultaneously: the repository has no
period-one Nash machinery for that shape, so blocks of that form are outside
this theorem's scope. -/
