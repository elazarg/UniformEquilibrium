# The canonical three-player quitting table goes through the cycle reduction

`FTVCyclicMinimality` carries the Flesch--Thuijsman--Vrieze three-player
quitting table

`r({0}) = (1, 3, 0)`, `r({1}) = (0, 1, 3)`, `r({2}) = (3, 0, 1)`,
`r({0,1}) = (1, 0, 1)`, `r({0,2}) = (0, 1, 1)`, `r({1,2}) = (1, 1, 0)`,
`r({0,1,2}) = (0, 0, 0)`,

together with the exact three-phase packet `standardPacket`: at phase `c`
coordinate `c` quits with probability `1/2` and the other two are silent, and
the promise word is `(1,2,1) → (1,1,2) → (2,1,1) → (1,2,1)`.  That file proves
the *value recursion* of the packet and its rigidity, but never connects it to
the quitting game itself.

This file makes the connection and runs the table through the landed
absorbing-cycle reduction of `QuittingZeroSoloDisjunct`:

* `ftvBlock_isQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` — the three phases assemble into
  an `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` for the terminal vector `(1,2,1)`.
  The value clause is the packet's own `q1` (`standardPromise_recursion`); what
  is added here is the per-stage *exact* endpoint-Nash certificate
  (`endpointDifference_phaseRoot`, `isZeroEndpointNash_phaseRoot`) and the
  absorption clause (all-continue mass `1/2` at every phase, so `1/8` around
  the cycle).
* `isQuittingCycleAdmissible_ftvBlockCycle` — admissibility, on the
  nonnegative-solo branch: every solo weight of this table is `1 > 0`.
* `isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_namedTarget` — the conclusion, with the payoff
  identified as `(1, 2, 1)`.

## Why this table

It is the standard witness that stationary strategies are not enough: it has
no stationary `ε`-equilibrium for small `ε` (Flesch--Thuijsman--Vrieze,
*Cyclic Markov equilibria in stochastic games*, IJGT 26(3), 303--314, 1997,
Theorem 3.2; the abstract's unqualified "(ε > 0)" reading is loose -- payoffs
lie in `[0,3]`, so every stationary profile is trivially a `3`-equilibrium,
and only the small-`ε` reading is correct).  So it is exactly the
case the absorbing-cycle carrier was built for, and it is a case where
admissibility is *automatic* rather than assumed.

## Scale

No rescaling is used.  Every bound consumed downstream is
`quittingRewardBound reward = ∑_S ∑_i |r_S(i)|`, the table's own canonical
bound, and the cycle notions are scale-homogeneous; nothing in the chain from
`IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` to `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` assumes a
reward bound of `1`.  The only place a numeric bound is needed is membership in
`quittingNashBellmanBox (quittingRewardBound ftvReward)`, which asks for
`|promise| ≤ quittingRewardBound ftvReward`; the promise entries are at most
`2` and `three_le_quittingRewardBound` supplies `3 ≤ quittingRewardBound
ftvReward` from a single table entry.

## What this does not claim

Nothing here says the cycle is the *only* equilibrium, nor that `(1,2,1)` is
the only uniform-equilibrium payoff.  The nonexistence of a stationary
`ε`-equilibrium for this table is *not* formalized here; it is the reason the
table is interesting, not a hypothesis or a conclusion of anything below.
