# The candidate hard weight's isolated-negative cycle

A solver reports an explicit two-player weight family, parametrized by
`0 < α < 1`, and claims that *every* complementary sequence for it has
deviation gain bounded below by `α`.  This file checks the reported cycle
and its gain -- the concrete part of that claim -- against the repository's
own quitting-game machinery.  The universally quantified floor over *every*
complementary sequence is **not** attempted here; see the closing remarks.

## The weight

Player `1` is encoded as `false`, player `2` as `true`.  `reward` is
`r({1}) = (-α, 1)`, `r({2}) = (-1, 1)`, `r({1,2}) = (-α, 0)`.  Coordinate
`2`'s own solo reward `r_2({2}) = 1 > 0` (`soloReward_true_true`) is the
fact the wider argument uses to force total absorption; nothing below needs
it, since this file only checks one already-complementary candidate cycle,
not the universal floor.

## The cycle

For every rate `0 < p < 1`, the stationary row at which player `1` quits
with probability `p` and player `2` never quits (`root`) is a length-one
absorbing exact (`ε = 0`) cyclic continuation block (`isCyclicContinuationBlock`)
-- i.e. a **complementary** cycle in the repository's sense, `p` and `1 - p`
are exact best responses at both coordinates simultaneously -- and it
isolates coordinate `1` (`isIsolated`): coordinate `2` is silent at every
phase.

Its value at coordinate `1` is exactly the solo reward `r_1({1}) = -α`
(`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_value_eq_soloReward_of_isolated`, not
restated here), and its anchored companion mismatch there is *exactly* `α`
(`mismatch_eq_alpha`) -- confirming both reported numbers.  In particular the
boundary-option supremum really is `max {0, -α} = 0`: the isolated companion
map is `w ↦ max {r_1({1}), w}` (`quittingRootCompanionMap_of_isolated`), so
the anchored orbit from `Λ_1 = max {0, r_1({1})}` never moves, and `Λ_1 = 0`
here (`soloQuitCap`) because `r_1({1}) = -α < 0`.  The deviation supremum is
contributed entirely by the "never activate coordinate `1`" option, matching
the reported route exactly; no finite-time deviation contributes anything
beyond what the fixed point already selects.

## What this file does not cover

`mismatch_eq_alpha` is a statement about **one** cycle for this weight, the
one the solver exhibited.  It is not a statement about every complementary
sequence for this weight, and complementarity (exact best response,
packaged here as `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`) is the only class the
claimed floor `∀ complementary sequence, max_i gain_i ≥ α` quantifies over;
a strategy profile with small deviation gain that is *not* complementary is
outside the floor's scope and outside this file's scope too.  Two further
steps are needed to reach the floor, neither of which is attempted here:

1. **Total absorption.**  That `r_2({2}) = 1 > 0` forces every complementary
   sequence (not just this cyclic one) to absorb with probability one, hence
   forces coordinate `2` silent at every time.  No lemma in the repository
   derives absorption *from* optimality plus a positive solo reward; the
   existing absorbing-cycle machinery always takes absorption at some stage
   as a hypothesis, not a conclusion.
2. **The floor itself**, universally quantified over arbitrary (not
   necessarily periodic) complementary sequences.  The repository's
   Bellman-exactness predicate for an infinite sequence,
   `IsQuittingLivePrescribedValue` (`QuittingBellmanTelescope.lean`), is
   stated for one coordinate against one root sequence, not jointly for
   every player at once; no repository definition currently packages "every
   coordinate is exactly best-responding at every time, no periodicity
   assumed" as a single `Prop` the way `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`
   does for finite periodic blocks.

Reaching the floor therefore needs both a new joint infinite-horizon
complementarity predicate and a new absorption theorem; neither is a
routine consequence of what already exists.
