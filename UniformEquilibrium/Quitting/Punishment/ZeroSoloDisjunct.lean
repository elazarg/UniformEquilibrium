# The zero-solo disjunct of the finite-quitting reduction

Write `Λ_i = max {0, r_i({i})}` for the solo-quit anchor of coordinate `i`
(`quittingPositiveSingletonDebtCap`).  A weight is **zero-solo** when `Λ = 0`,
i.e. when `r_i({i}) ≤ 0` at every coordinate.

On that class the whole program collapses to one profile.  Under all-continue
nobody ever absorbs, so the profile's terminal payoff is the zero vector.  A
unilateral deviation by `i` faces permanently silent opponents, so the only
absorbing event it can create is the singleton `{i}`, worth `r_i({i}) ≤ 0`;
never absorbing is worth `0`.  So all-continue is an *exact* terminal Nash
profile, and the exact terminal-to-uniform consumer delivers the zero vector
as a uniform-equilibrium payoff.

The absorbing-cycle route cannot reach these weights: absorption is exactly
what a zero-solo equilibrium refuses to do, and there are zero-solo weights
admitting no admissible absorbing cycle at all.  That is why the reduction is
stated below as a *disjunction*: a weight is covered either by this file's
zero-solo branch or by the cycle branch of
`QuittingAdmissibleCycleTerminalEquilibrium`.  Whether the second disjunct
holds on every weight with some `r_i({i}) > 0` is open; the disjunction as
stated here is a theorem.

## What is reused

Everything about the all-continue profile is already in `QuittingSimpleBranches`
(`quittingAlwaysContinueProfile`, its zero terminal payoff, and the exact
`ε`-Nash test `isεAsymptoticNash_quittingAlwaysContinue_iff`), and the exact
terminal-to-uniform step is `quittingGame_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_terminalNash_exact`
of `QuittingOwnerSoloCertification`.  Nothing here rebuilds them.

/-! ## The disjunct itself -/

/-- **The zero-solo disjunct.**  A zero-solo quitting game has the zero vector
as a uniform-equilibrium payoff, realized by all-continue.

`HEADLINE` — the unconditional half of the finite-quitting reduction: the
branch on which no equilibrium absorbs, hence the branch the absorbing-cycle
carrier of `QuittingAdmissibleCycleTerminalEquilibrium` provably cannot reach.
It covers only weights with `r_i({i}) ≤ 0` at *every* coordinate, and says
nothing about weights with some `r_i({i}) > 0`; the hypothesis is not
removable, since by
`isQuittingZeroSolo_of_isZeroAsymptoticNash_quittingAlwaysContinue` a single
coordinate with `r_i({i}) > 0` already destroys the all-continue profile's
exact optimality. -/

/-! ## The disjunctive reduction

The second disjunct, packaged as a `Prop` on the weight alone so that the two
branches can be stated side by side.
-/

/-- A weight **admits an admissible absorbing cycle** when some finite exact
Nash--Bellman block of positive length reproduces its own value at its origin,
absorbs at some stage, and has vanishing deviation mismatch at every
coordinate. -/

    IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock reward terminal (period + 1) block ∧
      IsQuittingCycleAdmissible reward
        (quittingCyclicContinuationBlockCycle period block)

/-- **The finite-quitting reduction, disjunctive form.**  A weight which is
either zero-solo or admits an admissible absorbing cycle has a uniform
equilibrium payoff.

`HEADLINE` — the current shape of the whole finite-quitting reduction in one
statement: the zero-solo branch is this file, the cycle branch is
`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_admissible_quittingCyclicContinuationBlock`.
What it does **not** cover is the completeness of the disjunction itself: that
*every* weight satisfies one of the two disjuncts is open, and is exactly the
remaining obligation of the program.  In particular this theorem is not an
unconditional existence result. -/

/-! ## The counterexample weight is in the zero-solo branch

The two-player table `r({1}) = (0, -1)`, `r({2}) = (1, -1)`, `r({1,2}) = (0,0)`
admits no admissible absorbing cycle (hand-checked, not formalized), which
refutes the unqualified reduction.  It is zero-solo — `r_1({1}) = 0` and
`r_2({2}) = -1` — so the disjunction survives it.  The instance below records
only the machine-checkable half: that this weight lands in the zero-solo
branch and therefore has a uniform equilibrium payoff.
