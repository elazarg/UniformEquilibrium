# Owner-solo certification, or a universal joining obstruction

The positive branch of the exact dynamic-debt split supplies a debt owner
with a strictly positive singleton reward, and terminal provenance identifies
the owner's optimal deviation as Continue-through-prefix followed by a solo
Quit.  This file certifies that deviation as prescribed play: the owner's
solo stationary root at any rate `p ∈ (0,1]` is an exact terminal Nash
equilibrium when every opponent's exact inactive inequality

`(1-p) * r_other({other}) + p * r_other({owner, other}) ≤ r_other({owner})`

holds.  The certified payoff is exactly `quittingSoloReward reward owner`.

Consequently positive debt has a sharper dichotomy.  Either some solo rate
certifies that payoff uniformly, or every positive rate has a strict joining
obstruction.  The obstruction supplies both a sure-rate strict joiner and,
by a finite minimum-gap argument, a weak preemptor at the vanishing-rate end.

reward is nonnegative and every opponent's inactive-Quit mixture is bounded
