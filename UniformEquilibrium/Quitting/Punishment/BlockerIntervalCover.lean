# Two blockers cover the owner's rate interval

Fix an owner `i` in a quitting game (the setting of Solan and Vieille,
*Quitting games*, Israel J. Math. 2001) and let every other player continue
surely while `i` quits at rate `h ∈ (0,1]`.  Opponent `j` weakly prefers to
stay out of the exit exactly when its *joining gain*

`d_ij(h) = (1-h) * r_j({j}) + h * r_j({i,j}) - r_j({i})`

is nonpositive, so the owner's solo row is an equilibrium row at rate `h`
exactly when `d_ij(h) ≤ 0` for every `j ≠ i` -- this is
`QuittingSoloQuitterCriterion`, and each `d_ij` is affine in `h`.

This file settles the structure of the *failure* of that criterion at every
rate.

## The designation that fails

If no rate works one might hope to designate a single opponent responsible
for it: some `j` with `d_ij(h) > 0` for every `h ∈ (0,1]`.  That designation
is false.  `QuittingSwitchingBlockerTable` is a three-player table whose two
joining gains are `d_01(h) = h - 2/5` and `d_02(h) = 3/5 - h`.  Their
maximum is at least `1/10` at *every* real rate, so the obstruction is
uniform and not an endpoint artefact; yet the first opponent is content at
every `h ≤ 2/5` and the second at every `h ≥ 3/5`, so neither blocks all
rates.  `QuittingSwitchingBlockerTable.not_exists_universalJoiner` is the
machine-checked refutation.

## What is true: two blockers whose intervals overlap

`exists_universalRateBlocker_or_switchingPair` is the replacement.  For a
finite family of affine functions covering `(0,1]` by positivity, either

* some member is positive on all of `(0,1]` (a universal blocker), or
* two distinct members `a ≠ b` and reals `0 < β < α ≤ 1` exist with `f a`
  positive on `(0, α)` and `f b` positive on `(β, 1]`.

The two intervals overlap on `(β, α)`, so the pair alone already covers
`(0,1]` (`isUniversalRateBlocker_of_initial_of_terminal`): *two* blockers
always suffice, and the switch between them happens strictly inside the
interval.  The proof is the affine classification of the
positivity sets -- empty, everything, an initial interval, or a terminal
interval -- plus one maximisation over the initial intervals.

## The two branches are not exclusive

`exists_family_isUniversalRateBlocker_and_switchingPair` exhibits a
three-member family satisfying *both* branches, so the disjunction above
cannot be upgraded to an exclusive one with the branches as stated: the
sharp statement is `exists_switchingPair_of_forall_not_isUniversalRateBlocker`,
where the switching pair is produced from the failure of the universal
branch.

## The quitting interface

`exists_soloQuitterRate_or_universalJoiner_or_switchingPair` is the corrected
gate: either some rate in `(0,1]` certifies the owner's solo row, or some
opponent `j` satisfies the endpoint inequalities `r_j({i}) ≤ r_j({j})` and
`r_j({i}) < r_j({i,j})` -- which
`isUniversalRateBlocker_quittingJoiningGain_iff` shows is exactly what it
means to block every rate -- or two opponents split the interval between
them as above.

/-! ## The two-blocker interval cover -/

/-- **The two-blocker interval cover, sharp form.**  Let a finite family of
affine functions cover `(0,1]`, in the sense that at every rate some member
is positive, and let no single member be positive on all of `(0,1]`.  Then
two *distinct* members already cover the interval, one on an initial segment
`(0, α)` and one on a terminal segment `(β, 1]`, with `0 < β < α ≤ 1`: the
two segments overlap, and the switch happens strictly inside `(0,1]`.

Distinctness is automatic rather than assumed: a single function positive on
`(0, α)` and on `(β, 1]` with `β < α` is positive on all of `(0,1]`, which
the hypothesis excludes. -/

variable {ι : Type} [Finite ι] [DecidableEq ι]

/-- **The corrected designation.**  If the owner's solo row fails at every
rate in `(0,1]`, then either some opponent blocks every rate -- equivalently,
by `isUniversalRateBlocker_quittingJoiningGain_iff`, satisfies
`r_j({i}) ≤ r_j({j})` and `r_j({i}) < r_j({i,j})` -- or two *distinct*
opponents split the interval, one blocking `(0, α)` and the other `(β, 1]`
with `0 < β < α ≤ 1`.

The second branch is not hypothetical: `QuittingSwitchingBlockerTable` is a
three-player table realising it, with no universal joiner at all. -/

/-! ## The three-player table refuting the single-blocker designation -/

namespace QuittingSwitchingBlockerTable

/-- A three-player quitting table with owner `0`.  Player `1` collects `1`
when `0` and `1` quit together, `2/5` when `0` quits without `1`, and `0`
otherwise; player `2` collects `0` when `0` and `2` quit together, `2/5`
when `0` quits without `2`, `1` when `2` quits without `0`, and `0`
otherwise; player `0` always collects `0`.

The six entries this pins down (see `reward_entries`) are

`r_1({1}) = 0`, `r_1({0}) = 2/5`, `r_1({0,1}) = 1`,
`r_2({2}) = 1`, `r_2({0}) = 2/5`, `r_2({0,2}) = 0`,

and they make the two joining gains against the owner's solo exit
`d_01(h) = h - 2/5` and `d_02(h) = 3/5 - h`. -/
