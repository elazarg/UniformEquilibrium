# The relaxed (`ε > 0`) hazard/row bridge

`QuittingHazardRowBridge.lean` bridges the real-valued hazard encoding
(`QuittingCyclicWeightRowDichotomy.lean`) and the `PMF Bool` mixture encoding
exactly -- but only at `ε = 0`: `IsExactRowComplementary` at a translated row
is equivalent to `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash reward tail 0 root`. The
exact-versus-relaxed programme lives at *positive* `ε`, where the objects of
interest -- relaxed cycles -- actually live, so this file extends the bridge
there.

## Contents

* `IsεRowComplementary`: the real-valued relaxed row condition, mirroring
  `IsExactRowComplementary` with slack `ε` on both clauses.
* `isεRowComplementary_zero_iff_isExactRowComplementary`: at `ε = 0` the new
  condition is definitionally the old one.
* `isεQuittingRootEndpointNash_of_isεRowComplementary_hazardOfRoot`: **the
  `ε`-bridge, forward direction**. `IsεRowComplementary ε` of the translated
  hazard row, with `ε` nonnegative, gives `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash reward
  tail ε root` at the *same* `ε` -- no worse constant.
* `exists_weighted_bound_not_isεRowComplementary`: **the reverse direction
  fails outright**, for every candidate row tolerance. A worked real-number
  counterexample isolating exactly the mechanism: the endpoint condition only
  bounds `x * g`, so as the hazard `x → 0⁺` the same weighted bound stays
  satisfied while `g → -∞`.
* `cyclicWeight_pred_le_of_pos_relaxed`: the relaxed equation (16), verbatim
  from the lower clause of `IsεRowComplementary`: `-ε ≤ g i` gives
  `p ≤ (3/4) s (1-p) + ε`.
* `cyclicWeight_pred_le_succ_add_eps_of_pos`: its linear corollary,
  `p ≤ (3/4) s + ε`.
* `cyclicWeight_le_four_mul_eps_of_all_pos`: if all three coordinates are
  active, each is at most `4ε`.
* `atMostOneExceeds_four_mul_eps_of_isεRowComplementary_cyclicWeight`: **the
  relaxed row dichotomy**. A row of `cyclicWeight` satisfying the lower
  complementarity clause with slack `ε`, together with a nonnegative centered
  next-phase value, has at most one coordinate exceeding `4ε`.

## Scope

The `ε`-bridge is one-directional. Going from a relaxed real-valued row to a
relaxed Bool-side root Nash costs nothing (`ε' = ε`, given `0 ≤ ε`): this is
the direction that matters for showing a row built on the real side (where
the questions corpus lives, per `QuittingHazardRowBridge.lean`'s own
docstring) is a genuine equilibrium on the `PMF Bool` side. Going the other
way -- extracting real-row structure from an assumed Bool-side relaxed Nash
-- is not possible for any finite row tolerance: `exists_weighted_bound_not_
isεRowComplementary` proves this precisely, so no strengthened statement is
being left on the table. This is a second, sharper asymmetry than the
existing bridge's domain restriction (rows outside `[0,1]` do not transport);
here even a row inside `[0,1]` does not transport back once `ε > 0`.

Consequently `atMostOneExceeds_four_mul_eps_of_isεRowComplementary_cyclicWeight`
below is stated, and can only be stated, on the real-hazard side: it is what
lets a relaxed cycle -- built and analyzed as a row of reals, as the whole
programme does -- be compared against an exact row's "at most one active
coordinate" without first having to (impossibly) recover row structure from a
Bool-side Nash hypothesis.

/-- **The reverse `ε`-bridge direction fails, for every finite row
tolerance.** Fixing the endpoint tolerance at `1`, for every candidate row
tolerance `εRow` there is a hazard `x ∈ (0,1)` and gain `g` whose weighted
bounds `(1 - x) * g ≤ 1` and `-1 ≤ x * g` both hold -- exactly the shape of a
single `who`-clause of `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash` -- while `g < -εRow`,
violating `IsεRowComplementary εRow`'s lower clause at that coordinate. This
is why no direction-reversing theorem is stated above: as `εRow → ∞` the
witnessing `x` is forced to `0⁺`, since the endpoint condition only controls
`x * g`, and shrinking `x` lets `g` diverge while the weighted product stays
bounded. -/
