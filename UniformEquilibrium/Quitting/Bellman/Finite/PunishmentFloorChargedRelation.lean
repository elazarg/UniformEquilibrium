# The punishment-floor reachable charged relation

This module attaches the actual one-stage absorption charge to every exact
Nash--Bellman predecessor edge reachable from the behavioral punishment
floor.

The orientation is important.  If `current` is an exact Nash--Bellman
predecessor of `tail`, the charged edge runs from `tail` to `current`.  Thus a
path starts at the punishment-floor anchor and grows outward by predecessor
selection, in the same direction as `quittingPunishmentFloorForwardPoint`.
The edge charge is the absorption mass of `current`'s root, which is the root
performing that Bellman update.

Reachability is deliberately existential and includes every legal exact
predecessor choice in the canonical box.  It is stronger than the one orbit
selected by classical choice in `PunishmentFloorForward`.  No compactness or
closedness of the reachable subtype is asserted.
