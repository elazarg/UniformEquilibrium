# A punishment-floor Nash--Bellman forward producer

The arbitrary compact Nash--Bellman spine admits the vacuous all-Continue
selection at the top of the reward box.  This module anchors the serial
selection instead at the coordinatewise behavioral punishment value.

The key invariant is one-stage and exact.  Suppose the declared continuation
value of player `i` is at least its punishment value.  Every exact Nash root
then has current payoff at least the same punishment value.  Indeed the
punishment value is below the stationary unilateral cap of the opponents'
row.  If the cap is attained by quitting, exact root Nash dominates that pure
endpoint.  If it is attained by waiting, the Bellman continuation endpoint
is still above the punishment value.  The degenerate row in which every
opponent surely continues is handled separately by the exact empty-row cap.

Consequently predecessor iteration from the punishment vector gives one
product-realizable forward predecessor orbit of exact one-stage Nash roots,
all of whose values are individually rational.  Its finite prefixes are
`QuittingFiniteForwardPacket`s.  Therefore unbounded cumulative absorption
on this selected orbit already implies a uniform-equilibrium payoff through
the existing finite charged-return and single-seam compiler.

The branch left by this selected producer is explicit: cumulative absorption
of its punishment-floor orbit is bounded.  The predecessor at each step is
fixed by classical choice, so this is not a common bound over every legal
predecessor orbit.  It is a concrete finite-charge projective boundary source,
not a game-intrinsic classification of all selections.
