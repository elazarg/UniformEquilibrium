# Bellman-path selection from joint absorption

The existing nonperiodic path compiler selects bounded Bellman values under
playerwise opponent-survival contraction.  For support-witness paths obtained
by reversing absorbing circulation prefixes, the natural contraction is
instead the canonical joint all-continue survival weight.  This file records
the corresponding selection theorem and the absorption lower-bound criteria
that feed it.

Because a root successor depends affinely on the declared all-continue tail,
the difference of two policy-evaluation paths is multiplied exactly by the
joint continue mass at every stage.  Thus vanishing joint survival is already
sufficient for uniqueness.  A uniform positive one-stage absorption lower
bound makes joint survival geometric and also makes total absorption charge
nonsummable.
