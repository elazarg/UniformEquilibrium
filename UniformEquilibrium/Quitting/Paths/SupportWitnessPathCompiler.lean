# Support-witness path compiler

A witness-retaining path carries more information than bare membership in a
set-valued quitting correspondence: every action used with positive
probability is approximately optimal at the actual continuation carried by
that path.  This retained support information makes Simon's stochastic
rank-one Case 1 unnecessary.  The ledger clock is dominated deterministically
by the players' own survival clocks, and the first own-survival crossing can
be used as the phase switch.

This module closes the remaining analytic and game-theoretic bridges from
such a path to terminal and uniform equilibrium statements.

* Divergence of the sum of one-stage absorption probabilities implies complete
  absorption.
* Approximate individual rationality supplies the selected player's closed
  tail, with the rationality error charged only once.
* A completely absorbing `δ`-support-witness path that is `r`-rational at
  every continuation compiles to terminal Nash error

  `2δ + r + sqrt(δ) * (2 + 7M)`.

* Consequently, support error `δ` and rationality error `ε` give a direct
  `3ε` theorem whenever

  `2δ + sqrt(δ) * (2 + 7M) ≤ 2ε`.

* If witness-retaining, individually rational, divergently absorbing paths
  exist at every positive accuracy, the quitting game has a uniform-
  equilibrium payoff.

The support contribution is `O(sqrt δ)`.  Thus this retained-witness route
needs only quadratic-scale support accuracy for linear equilibrium accuracy,
in contrast with the fourth-order support restriction in Simon's published
Case-1 argument after the support witness has been forgotten.

The remaining problem is path production: construct witness-retaining paths
which are approximately individually rational at every continuation and have
divergent total absorption.  Punishment assembly, ledger accumulation, and
deleted-survival bookkeeping are discharged here.

/-- **Quantitative support-witness path compiler.**

A completely absorbing path whose one-stage roots satisfy the support-local
`δ` condition and whose continuation values are within `rationalityError` of
every player's punishment value produces a terminal approximate Nash profile
with error

`2δ + rationalityError + sqrt(δ) * (2 + 7M)`.

The square-root scale is used for both the ledger cap and the own-survival
threshold. -/

Here `δ` is the support error and `ε` is the individual-rationality error.
If the support-generated overhead is at most `2ε`, then the compiled path is
a terminal `3ε`-Nash profile.  The condition is

`2δ + sqrt(δ) * (2 + 7M) ≤ 2ε`.

In particular, support accuracy of quadratic order in `ε` suffices. -/

/-- **Uniform-payoff theorem from witness-retaining paths.**

Assume that for every positive `δ` there is a root path satisfying:

* support-wise `δ` one-stage optimality;
* divergent total absorption `sum q(p_i) = infinity`; and
* `δ`-individual rationality at every continuation.

Then the finite quitting game has a uniform-equilibrium payoff. -/
