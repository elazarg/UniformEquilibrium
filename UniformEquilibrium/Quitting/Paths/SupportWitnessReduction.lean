# Uniform-equilibrium reduction through support witnesses

`QuittingSupportWitnessClockCollapse` removes the stochastic Case-1 crossing
estimate once the one-stage action witnessing Simon's `Eδ` correspondence is
retained.  This file compiles that deterministic switch package into an
actual terminal approximate Nash profile.

The only continuation datum left is player-indexed and one-sided.  For every
possible marked target, one supplies a tail on which that target is already a
best reply and whose target value is close to the plan's value at the switch.
No common punishment tail is required.  After the global first own-survival
crossing selects the marked target, its closed tail is spliced onto the plan.

* the marked target is controlled by the prefix ledger and the closed-tail
  continuation value;
* every other player is controlled by the selected target's small own
  survival, since that survival is a factor of their deleted reach; and
* the target's prescribed payoff changes by only the plan's small joint reach.

The resulting error is

`ledgerCap + 2 * δ + continuationSlack + 7 * threshold * rewardBound`.

Thus support-witness packages at every positive accuracy yield a single
uniform-equilibrium payoff by the existing compact payoff-selection theorem.

/-- The support-witness producer needed by the deterministic phase-switch
compiler.  The global switch is the first stage at which some player's own
planned survival falls below `threshold`.

The tail clause is player-indexed: after the switch has selected `target`, a
different target-closed tail may be chosen for that player. -/

/-- **Support-witness terminal-equilibrium compiler.**  A support-local
witness sequence, one genuine own-survival crossing, and a player-indexed
closed tail at the selected boundary produce a terminal `ε`-Nash profile.

This is the source-faithful replacement for the old all-player deleted-reach
package.  The marked player only needs joint reach; deleted reach is required
for the other players and is supplied automatically by the marked player's
own survival clock. -/
