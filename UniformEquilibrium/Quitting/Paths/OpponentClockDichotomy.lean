# Divergent and summable opponent clocks

This file isolates the exact analytic split available after a compatible
sequence of quitting roots has been selected.  The one-stage charge for a
player is the probability that one of that player's opponents quits.  If
the charge series diverges, the corresponding finite opponent-survival
products tend to zero.  If it is summable, some suffix instead has strictly
positive opponent survival; in fact that suffix can be chosen with limiting
survival at least `1 / 2`.

Thus every root path has an exhaustive dichotomy:

* every player's opponent clock diverges, and every conditional opponent
  survival tail vanishes; or
* one player has a summable opponent clock and a positive-survival suffix.

The second branch is only a probabilistic boundary.  It does **not** by
itself imply that the prescribed path absorbs, that its Bellman values are
Cauchy, or that its live suffixes are terminal Nash profiles.  The final
theorem records the additional all-tail absorption and terminal-Nash
hypotheses consumed by the existing exceptional stationary fallback.
