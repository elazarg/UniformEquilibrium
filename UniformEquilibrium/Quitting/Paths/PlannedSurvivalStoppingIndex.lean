# The planned-survival stopping index

Simon (Adv. Appl. Math. 38 (2007) 1-26), Proposition 3, punishes a deviating
player off **two** per-player stopping times: a cumulative-ledger clock, and
a **planned-survival** clock `i^n_♯` -- the first stage at which the
player's own *prescribed* continuation probability
`c_i^n := ∏_{k<i} (1 − p_k^n)` has fallen to or below a target threshold
`ε/M`.  The point of this second clock is that it needs no statistical test
at all: `c_i^n` is computed from the prescribed hazard sequence alone,
before any play happens, so a player still observed live past `i^n_♯` is
*provably* off the prescribed path -- mere presence is the certificate,
not a realized-history statistic.

This file isolates that deterministic stopping index for the planned
survival curve `quittingHazardSurvival`, already defined in
`QuittingBehaviorStoppingLaw.lean` for an arbitrary Boolean hazard sequence
and, via `quittingBehaviorLiveHazard`, for an arbitrary (possibly
history-dependent) behavior strategy read along a quitting game's unique
live public history.

This is a standalone piece of Proposition 3's punishment design: a
definition and its defining inequalities, with **no capping theorem**
attached.  Proposition 3's actual content -- bounding a deviator's gain once
the trigger fires, via a rank-1 decision-discrepancy-process argument -- is
separate, larger work and is not attempted here.

## Main definitions

* `quittingPlannedSurvivalStoppingIndex` -- the first stage at which a
  planned (prescribed, history-free) survival curve drops to or below a
  threshold, or `0` if it never does
* `quittingBehaviorPlannedSurvivalStoppingIndex` -- the same index read off
  an arbitrary behavior strategy's live-path hazard sequence

## Main results

* `quittingHazardSurvival_stoppingIndex_le` -- survival is at or below the
  threshold at the stopping index
* `threshold_lt_quittingHazardSurvival_of_lt_stoppingIndex` -- survival is
  strictly above the threshold at every earlier stage (the "first crossing"
  property)
* `quittingHazardSurvival_le_of_stoppingIndex_le` -- survival stays at or
  below the threshold from the stopping index on

/-- The first stage at which a planned (prescribed) survival curve drops to
or below `threshold`, or `0` if it never does.  Applied to
`c_i^n = quittingHazardSurvival hazard i` with `threshold = ε / M`, this is
Simon's stopping time `i^n_♯`: the point past which the prescribed plan
already has the player gone with probability at least `1 − ε/M`. -/
