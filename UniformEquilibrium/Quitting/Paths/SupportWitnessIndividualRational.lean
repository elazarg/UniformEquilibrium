# Individual rationality supplies the support-witness tail

The support-witness compiler in `QuittingSupportWitnessReduction` asks for a
player-indexed closed tail at the selected switch.  That tail is not extra
strategic structure.  The quitting min--max theorem already says that each
player's punishment value is the infimum of stationary unilateral caps, and
every stationary cap is attained by an actual behavioral response.

Consequently, whenever the plan's continuation value at the switch is at
least the selected player's punishment value, any positive slack supplies a
stationary row whose cap lies below the continuation value plus that slack.
Keeping the row's opponents stationary and installing its cap-attaining
response as the player's prescribed behavior gives the required closed tail.

This file replaces the player-indexed tail producer by the ordinary
individual-rationality inequalities at one deterministic switch.  Together
with support-local one-stage witnesses and a genuine own-survival crossing,
those inequalities imply terminal approximate Nash profiles and hence a
uniform-equilibrium payoff at all accuracies.
