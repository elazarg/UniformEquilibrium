# Survival-window landing by continuation lifting

A global near-equilibrium plan cannot cross a multiplicative survival window
in one stage.  The chain has three links, each stated here at its own
generality.

## (1) The reached-stage transfer lemma

A deviation that follows the plan strictly before a stage, deviates at that
stage, and resumes afterwards leaves the prefix untouched, so its *global*
gain is the joint survival through the stage times its *conditional* gain.
Hence a globally `ε`-optimal root sequence is, at every stage reached with
positive joint survival `S`, one-stage `(ε / S)`-Nash against its own
continuation vector.  This is the quitting one-shot-deviation principle with
reach-probability scaling.

The global cap is taken at the **root-sequence** level
(`IsεQuittingRootSequenceNash`), matching the hypothesis shape the
phase-switch deviation cap already consumes;
`isεQuittingRootSequenceNash_iff_isεAsymptoticNash` identifies it with the
tree's `IsεAsymptoticNash` for the terminal payoff, so nothing is lost.

## (2) The continuation lift

The transfer lemma alone does not certify that the plan's continuation is
individually rational: rationality by the same scaling would cost the reach
probability `S * c`, which is small precisely at the jump one is trying to
exclude.  The repair replaces the continuation coordinatewise by

> `quittingLiftedContinuation _ = max (continuation value) (reservation)`,

which dominates the reservation vector by construction, at no cost in reach
probability.  The row is still one-stage `(ε / S)`-Nash against the lift:
the deviation side is carried by the securing tail response
(`IsQuittingConditionalReservation`), the prescribed side by monotonicity of
`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff` in the tail — the recursion is affine with
slope the (nonnegative) continue mass.

The reservation vector is a **parameter**.  The hypothesis actually consumed
is that each player has a *conditional* tail response securing it against
the plan's opponent tail; a min-max level taken as an infimum over profiles
implies that hypothesis, but the two are not interchanged here.

## (3) The no-large-jump lemma and the landing

The published per-stage bound — every row that is one-stage `ρ`-endpoint-Nash
against a `ρ`-rational continuation keeps continue mass at least `ρ` — is
**not** proved here; it is a hypothesis of the theorems that use it.  Granted
it, `S_i ≥ ε / ρ` forces `c(p_i) ≥ ρ`, and the elementary sequence lemma
`exists_mem_survivalWindow_of_ratio_ge` lands the survival product in the
closed window `[ρ * T, T]`.

## Main results

* `exists_mem_survivalWindow_of_ratio_ge` — the pure sequence lemma
* `isεQuittingRootNash_tailVector_of_isεQuittingRootSequenceNash` — (1)
* `isεQuittingRootNash_quittingLiftedContinuation` — (2)
* `le_quittingStationaryContinueMass_of_le_jointSurvivalWeight` — (3), the
  no-large-jump lemma
* `exists_jointSurvivalWeight_mem_survivalWindow` — the landing

/-! ## The pure sequence lemma -/

/-- **The window-landing sequence lemma.**  A real sequence that starts at or
above `ratio * window`, never loses more than the factor `ratio` at a stage
where it is still strictly above `window`, and reaches a value at most
`window`, has some term in the closed window `[ratio * window, window]`.

The sequence is not assumed monotone and no upper bound on `ratio` is
needed: the first crossing index does all the work. -/

plays `dev` at the stage and then a response worth at least the lift minus a
slack, and the whole deviation conditions on reaching the stage — probability
`S`, not `S * c`.  The prescribed side is monotonicity of the one-stage
payoff in the tail. -/

/-- **The granted per-stage bound.**  Every row that is one-stage
`ratio`-endpoint-Nash against a `ratio`-rational continuation keeps continue
mass at least `ratio`.

This is the published Lemma 5(2)(b).  It is **not** proved here: it is a
hypothesis, packaged as a predicate on the reward so that the theorems below
say exactly what they consume. -/

/-- **(3) The no-large-jump lemma.**  Granted the per-stage bound, a globally
`ε`-optimal plan cannot lose more than the factor `ratio` at a stage whose
joint survival is at least `ε / ratio`.

The lifted continuation is what makes the granted bound applicable: it is
`0`-rational, hence `ratio`-rational, at no cost in reach probability, so the
circle "the jump destroys the reach probability that would forbid the jump"
never closes. -/

/-- **The survival-window landing.**  Granted the per-stage bound, a globally
`ε`-optimal plan whose joint survival ever drops to `window` — with accuracy
`ε ≤ ratio * window` and `ratio * window ≤ 1` — has some stage whose joint
survival lies in the closed window `[ratio * window, window]`.

With `window = θ/3` and `ratio = ρ` this is the published window; the
accuracy requirement is only `ε ≤ ρθ/3`. -/
