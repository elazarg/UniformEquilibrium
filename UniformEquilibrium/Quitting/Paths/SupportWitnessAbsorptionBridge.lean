# Complete absorption supplies the support-survival switch

The support-witness compiler uses the first date at which one player's own
prescribed survival drops below a fixed threshold.  Simon's source hypothesis
is instead complete absorption, or equivalently vanishing joint survival.
For finitely many players these formulations are linked by the exact product
identity

`joint survival = product over players of own survival`.

Consequently, if joint survival tends to zero, every positive threshold is
crossed by at least one player's own survival at some finite date.  Combining
this observation with the support-witness clock collapse and the
individual-rational target-tail construction gives a direct terminal-Nash and
uniform-payoff compiler for completely absorbing witness-carrying paths.
