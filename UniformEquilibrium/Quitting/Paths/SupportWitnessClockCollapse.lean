# Support witnesses collapse Simon's ledger clock

A bare membership `next ∈ Fδ(current)` forgets which one-stage mixed action
witnesses the membership.  Simon's source correspondence carries the witness:
whenever an action is used with positive probability, that action is within
`δ` of the other endpoint.  Retaining this support-local information has a
strong consequence for the phase-switch proof.

For player `who` at stage `k`, write `q_k` for the prescribed Quit
probability and `D_k` for Quit minus Continue.  The ledger identity already
proved in `QuittingLedgerPunishClock` is

`ledgerIncrement_k = -q_k * D_k`.

The support condition `q_k > 0 -> D_k >= -δ` therefore gives

`ledgerIncrement_k <= δ * q_k`.

The elementary product--sum inequality

`(∏_{k<n} (1-q_k)) * (1 + ∑_{k<n} q_k) <= 1`

then implies the clock-collapse theorem: if own planned survival is still
strictly above `threshold` and `δ <= ledgerCap * threshold`, the ledger is
still strictly below `ledgerCap`.  Thus a ledger crossing forces an own
survival crossing.  No rank-one martingale or crossing-count estimate is
needed for a path that retains its support witness.

The final package uses the first stage at which *some* player's own survival
crosses the threshold.  Before that stage every ledger is below the cap; at
the stage itself every ledger is below `ledgerCap + δ`; and one selected
player supplies joint survival for itself and deleted survival for every
other player.  This is exactly the asymmetric survival interface consumed by
`QuittingMarkedPhaseSwitchCap`.
