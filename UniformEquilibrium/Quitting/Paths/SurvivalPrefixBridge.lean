# The survival-prefix bridge

The survival-prefix notion has two forms with no lemma relating them before
this file:

* the **full-product** form `quittingSurvivalPrefix rows N =
  ∏ t < N, quittingStationaryContinueMass (rows t)`
  (`QuittingUnboundedInverseIterate.lean`), the joint probability that every
  player continues at every one of the first `N` stages, used for complete
  absorption;
* the **deleted-product** form `quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight roots who
  start fuel = ∏ offset < fuel, quittingFixedOpponentsContinueMass roots who
  (start + offset)` (`QuittingBellmanTelescope.lean`), the probability that
  every *opponent* of `who` continues, used throughout the isolated-coordinate
  case split (`QuittingCycleIsolatedCoordinate.lean`,
  `QuittingRelaxedCycleGain.lean`).

The bridge is exactly what factoring `who`'s own coordinate out of the joint
product gives: at a single root, the joint continue mass is the deleted
(opponents-only) continue mass times `who`'s own continue probability
(`quittingStationaryContinueMass_eq_deletedContinueMass_mul_own`). Lifting
this pointwise identity across a finite prefix via `Finset.prod_mul_distrib`
gives the prefix-level bridge
(`quittingSurvivalPrefix_eq_opponentSurvivalWeight_mul_own`): the full survival
prefix is the opponent survival weight times the prefix of `who`'s own
continue probabilities. Without this, translating a complete-absorption fact
stated on `quittingSurvivalPrefix` into an opponent-survival-weight statement
(as the isolated-coordinate case split needs) has no shortcut and must be
re-derived by hand at each use site.

This file is deliberately thin: it imports both sides
(`QuittingUnboundedInverseIterate.lean` for the full-product form,
`QuittingBellmanTelescope.lean` and `QuittingCycleMismatchContraction.lean`
for the deleted-product form) so that any file consuming either side can also
consume the bridge without an extra import of its own.
