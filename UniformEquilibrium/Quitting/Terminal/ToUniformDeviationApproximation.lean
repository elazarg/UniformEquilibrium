# From asymptotic Nash to uniform finite-horizon Nash

This file isolates the exact one-sided approximation needed to turn Nash
inequalities for a limiting payoff functional into uniform finite-horizon
Nash inequalities for the same profile.

For every long horizon and every finite-horizon deviation, the approximation
property supplies a (possibly different) deviation whose limiting payoff
dominates the finite-horizon deviation payoff up to a prescribed error.  This
is deliberately one-sided.  Uniform absolute convergence over all deviations
is stronger and is false in quitting games: a player can postpone a quit past
the current horizon.

The generic transfer theorem also uses ordinary pointwise convergence only
for the prescribed profile.  The quitting-specific content of
Solan--Vieille Proposition 2.13 is precisely to establish the one-sided
approximation property from the unique live history and stopping-time
structure of a quitting game.
