# Realized finite marked absorption cylinders

This file is a source-retaining realization adapter for the marked-
absorption-path route.  It deliberately has no source-forgetting cylinder,
infinite carrier, topology, closure statement, or decoder.  A realized object
retains an existing calibrated exact-`D` `QuittingAnchoredBoundaryBlock`,
including its literal horizon and chronology; its stored endpoint scalars and
packet/debt coordinates are pinned back to that source.

The absorption samples use `Math.PMFProduct.coalitionMass` and retain their
chronological stage index.  Thus zero-mass stages remain visible and the
obstacle is not presented as a function of accumulated mass.  The final
index of an obstacle sample is the existing finite-horizon zero-boundary
(`never`) sentinel.  It is not generally an obstacle quit date and is not
equal to the holonomy `early` cap (for example, with negative quit rewards it
contributes zero while the early cap may be negative).  Mark transport,
source-forgetting, and all infinite-path claims remain open obligations of
the later generalized-trace layer.

/-! ## The finite marked object -/

/--
A source-retaining realized marked absorption cylinder over one existing
calibrated chain.  It is an adapter for finite semantics, not the
source-forgetting target cylinder.

The fields `sExit`, `chi`, `cap`, `preterminalSurvival`, `terminalMass`,
`advantage`, and `entryDebt` are intentionally stored rather than defined by
projection.  Their accompanying pins make the representation exact while
leaving a future compactification free to use them as coordinates.

## Same-source realized concatenation

The following operations concern only adjacent blocks cut from the same
calibrated source anchor.  They establish source holonomy and clock laws;
they are not composition laws for a source-forgetting cylinder and make no
claim about absorption-path, obstacle, cap, packet, or debt composition.
