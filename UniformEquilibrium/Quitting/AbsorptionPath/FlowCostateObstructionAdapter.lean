# Two-grade flow/co-state form of a finite quitting obstruction

This file embeds the annotated survival block of a literal finite quitting
window into `Math.LinearProgramming.FlowCostateDuality`.  There are exactly
two grades:

* `charge`, of survival degree one, contains the raw singleton and collision
  charges;
* `coboundary`, of survival degree zero, contains the signed playerwise
  endpoint displacement.

The common finite coordinate carrier is the sum of raw charge channels and
players.  Coordinates outside the indicated grade are zero.  With the
identity graded operator, adjacent source-window concatenation is exactly
`survivalTransport`: later raw charges are multiplied by earlier survival,
while later endpoint displacement is not.

The final theorems expose the resulting decomposition against an arbitrary
finite co-state.  They do not assert that the raw flow belongs to a strategic
feasible set, select a co-state, establish boundary exhaustion, expose a face,
or decode a strategic repair or return.
