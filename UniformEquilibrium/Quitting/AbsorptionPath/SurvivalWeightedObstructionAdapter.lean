# Survival-weighted obstruction carried by a finite quitting window

This file maps a literal `QuittingFiniteRootWindow` into the generic raw
accounting algebra of `Math.SurvivalWeightedObstruction`.  The survival clock
is the joint Continue probability.  The nonnegative charge channels are the
raw singleton-owner masses and one collision mass.  Calendar-indexed value
annotations supply the entry and exit values, so their difference is the
grade-zero endpoint coboundary.

Adjacent source windows concatenate exactly.  Singleton and collision charges
in the later window are transported by the earlier joint survival, while the
endpoint coboundary is not.  The induced tangent is therefore exactly the
literal endpoint displacement divided by window absorption mass.

This is an accounting adapter only.  It does not identify a charge with a
strategically feasible occupation, choose or expose a co-state, realize a
product-root word, compare the surviving boundary remainder, or prove boundary
exhaustion.  Payoff delivery and refusal semantics remain in their existing
game-facing modules.
