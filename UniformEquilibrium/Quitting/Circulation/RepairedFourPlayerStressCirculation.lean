# The repaired four-player family's circulation certificate at its stress point

This followup repairs the four-player
cyclic weight `F(x, ε)` to `F'(x, λ)` by moving the second solo coordinate from
`0` to `x` (`solo r({i})`: `i ↦ 1, i+1 ↦ 3, i+2 ↦ x, i+3 ↦ 0`).  The followup's
answer ("## Answer to followup") produces a singleton-face circulation
certificate for every `x > 0, λ ≥ 0` (§4) and names
`(x, λ) = (2, 1)` as "the hardest stress test for the remaining exact-cycle
classification" (§7): it lies off every bounded-period exact branch the answer
proves (`x > 1` rules out the opposite-player branch, `λ ≤ 2` rules out the
symmetric branch, `x ≠ 1` and `λ > 0` rule out the singleton lock).

This file machine-checks the answer's §4 certificate data at exactly that
point and instantiates the singleton-orbit theorem of
`SingletonFaceCirculationOrbit.lean` on it. The downstream module
`QuittingCirculationUniformPayoffExamples.lean` verifies the formal
punishment-floor condition and compiles this certificate to a
uniform-equilibrium payoff.

## The transcribed data

At `x = 2`, `λ = 1`:

* `a = a(2) = 1/2`, from the followup's `a(x) = (1 - x + √((x-1)² + 8)) / 4`
  (equation (1)); the answer records this value directly in §7.
* the payoff `v(2) = (1, 2, 2, 1)` (§7), which is `V^0` of §4's equation (39)
  `V^0 = (1, 3 - 2a, 1/a, 1)` at `a = 1/2`.
* the four singleton payoff rows `R^k`, the rotations of `R^0 = (1, 3, 2, 0)`
  under `ρ(v₀, v₁, v₂, v₃) = (v₃, v₀, v₁, v₂)` (§4): `R^0 = (1,3,2,0)`,
  `R^1 = (0,1,3,2)`, `R^2 = (2,0,1,3)`, `R^3 = (3,2,0,1)`.
* the four cycle vertices `V^k = ρ^k V^0`: `V^0 = (1,2,2,1)`, `V^1 = (1,1,2,2)`,
  `V^2 = (2,1,1,2)`, `V^3 = (2,2,1,1)`, satisfying the answer's boxed identity
  (equation (40)) `V^k = (1 - a) R^k + a V^{k+1}` -- checked below by
  `norm_num` at every `k`, with the exact rationals of §4.1, not a numeric
  approximation.

`FaceCirculationCertificate.step` is stated *forward*
(`vertex (l+1) = ratio l * vertex l + (1 - ratio l) * mixTarget ...`), while
the answer's equation (40) is stated *backward* in its own cyclic index `k`
(matching the "backward orbit convention" the orbit file's docstring already
flags).  The certificate below reads the answer's cycle in reverse,
`vertex l := V^{-l}`, with phase `l`'s owner set to coordinate `V^{-l-1}`'s
label; §4.1's identity `V^k_k = V^{k+1}_k = 1` (equation (43)) is exactly what
makes the owner pinning below hold on the nose.

## The floor

The answer's floor is `max{d_i, χ_i}`, `d_i` the solo diagonal and `χ_i` the
true min-max (`Scope` note of `SingletonFaceCirculation.lean`).  Here
`d_i = stressWeight {i} i = 1` for every `i` (read off the table, no
computation needed), and §2.3/§2.4 compute the exact min-max at the branch
`x ≥ x₊(λ)` (equation (14)): at `(2, 1)`,
`x₊(1) = 1 - 1/((1+1)²(2+1)) = 11/12 ≤ 2`, so `χ(2,1) = q_1 = (1+1)/(2+1) =
2/3` (the boxed equation (14)'s upper branch).  That min-max computation --
the supersolution algebra of §2.2/§2.3 -- is **quoted, not formalized here**,
exactly as `cyclicCirculationFloor`'s docstring already quotes the
three-coordinate min-max for its own calibration instance.  The floor used
below is the constant `1`, which is `d_i` exactly and dominates the quoted
`χ(2,1) = 2/3` with room to spare; `solo_le_floor` is proved unconditionally
from the table, so the only unformalized input is the strict inequality
`χ(2,1) < 1`, needed only for the informal reading "the floor is
`max{d, χ}`" and not for any field of the certificate itself.

## Contents

* `stressWeight`: the repaired family's weight at `(x, λ) = (2, 1)`, all
  sixteen rows.
* `stressFloor`, `stressVertex`, `stressOwner`: the floor and the reversed
  cycle of §4.1.
* `stressCirculation`: the `FaceCirculationCertificate`, with every step
  identity, floor bound, and pinning clause checked by `norm_num`.
* `stressCirculationSupport`: its point-mass presentation.
* `exists_stressCirculation_orbit`: the instantiated singleton-orbit theorem
  -- for every `ε > 0` and target quit mass `Q`, a rational discretization
  whose states obey the one-stage recursion, stay support-perfect at
  tolerance `ε`, stay above the floor forever, and whose quit mass exceeds
  `Q` on a finite prefix.

## What this does and does not give

What is machine-checked: the four singleton payoff rows and the four cycle
vertices exist as stated with exact rational coordinates; the closing
identities `V^k = (1-a) R^k + a V^{k+1}` hold on the nose at `a = 1/2`; the
floor `1` dominates every solo value and every vertex sits above it; the
phase owners are pinned on both the ideal vertex and the phase target; and,
from all of that through `SingletonFaceCirculationOrbit.lean`'s general
machinery, orbits of arbitrarily large prefix quit mass exist at this weight,
support-perfect at any prescribed tolerance, above the floor forever.  All of
this is first proved at the level of `L` (the game's live-state Bellman
recursion, `oneStageNext`). The downstream singleton-circulation compiler
turns the resulting path into a uniform-equilibrium payoff.

What is *not* checked here: that `χ(2,1) = 2/3` (quoted above, from §2.3's
supersolution algebra). That exact value is not needed for the formal
cashout: `QuittingCirculationUniformPayoffExamples.lean` instead proves that
the actual `quittingPunishmentValue` is at most the floor `1` from the
general `max (solo payoff) 0` bound, and then applies the
singleton-circulation compiler.

stays at or above the floor `1`, whose states obey the one-stage Bellman
