# The circulation certificate class, measured at two coordinates

The face-circulation certificate (`FaceCirculationCertificate`, in
`SingletonFaceCirculation.lean`) is the program's newest existence engine.
This file asks whether it is real at `n = 2`, where the two-player capstone
(`QuittingTwoPlayerExistence.lean`) already closes the whole conjecture by a
four-way case split, or whether circulation is strictly a high-`n` device.

## The two-coordinate reduction

At `ι = Bool` an `L = 1` certificate collapses completely: `ZMod 1` is a
subsingleton, so `vertex`, `mixWeight`, `ratio` are each a single value
`z, λ, α`, and the `step` equation `z = α z + (1 - α) u` (with `u` the mixed
target `mixTarget r λ`) forces `z = u` since `α < 1`. What survives is
exactly

* `λ : Bool → ℝ` a distribution on the two players (`CirculationL1Feasible`);
* `u = λ_false · r{false} + λ_true · r{true}`, the mix of the two solo rows;
* `u ≥ floor` at both coordinates;
* pinning: `λ_j > 0 ⟹ u_j = r{j}_j` (`d_j`, `j`'s own solo value).

`faceCirculationCertificate_one_bool_iff` proves this reduction directly from
the real structure. `circulationL1Feasible_bool_iff` then closes
`CirculationL1Feasible` into the two-coordinate disjunction, mirroring
`Math.LinearProgramming.SingletonLCP`'s `singletonLCPFeasible_bool_iff`: a
pure witness at `false`, a pure witness at `true`, or a mixed witness. Unlike
the LCP case, the mixed disjunct is *not* a genuine third case here: solving
its two pinning equations forces `r{false} = r{true}` outright, at which
point it is subsumed by either pure disjunct. So the closed form is a clean
two-way split, `(∀ j, floor j ≤ r{false} j) ∨ (∀ j, floor j ≤ r{true} j)`.

## The floor and the min-max parameter

`floor j = max (d_j) (χ_j)` with `χ` the (unformalized) min-max level,
constrained only by `χ_j ≤ max 0 (d_j)` (`ValidFloorFor`,
`validFloorFor_iff_exists_chi`). This pins the *achievable range* of `floor`
to the interval `[d_j, max 0 (d_j)]`, independent of `χ`'s real value. Asking
whether *some* admissible `χ` gives a certificate (`CirculationTwoExists`)
therefore reduces to the *easiest* floor, `floor = d` — always achievable,
since `χ_j := d_j` satisfies the bound trivially — giving the headline
closed form (`circulationTwoExists_iff`):

  `CirculationTwoExists v0 v1 ↔ v1 true ≤ v0 true ∨ v0 false ≤ v1 false`.

Reading `v0 = r{false}`, `v1 = r{true}`: the class holds exactly when one
player's own solo value is dominated by the *other* player's cross payoff.

## The verdict

None of the two-player capstone's four branches implies this disjunction.
Each admits an explicit weight, built from `sampleReward`, satisfying the
branch's own hypotheses — and, for the two branches checked against the
headline theorems directly, actually producing a uniform-equilibrium payoff
via that branch — while failing `circulationTwoExists_iff` at both
disjuncts (`pairRepair_exists_outside_circulationTwoExists`,
`soloRate_exists_outside_circulationTwoExists`,
`jointExit_exists_outside_circulationTwoExists`,
`zeroSolo_exists_outside_circulationTwoExists`).

The pair-repair branch, flagged as the one needing genuinely approximate
equilibria, is confirmed **outside** the circulation class: its two defining
inequalities (`howner`, `hblocker`) pull in exactly the wrong direction for
the pure-witness case they most resemble (`hblocker` gives
`v0 true ≤ v1 true`, the reverse of what `circulationTwoExists_iff`'s second
disjunct needs), so satisfying them generically breaks both disjuncts at
once. But the same construction breaks all three *other* branches too. The
verdict is not "circulation misses one branch" but the stronger fact that
**the `L = 1` circulation floor is a strictly stronger rationality demand
than two-player Nash rationality**: it asks a player's equilibrium payoff to
dominate its own solo value at every coordinate, which no branch of the
capstone guarantees (each branch's mechanism can legitimately hand a player
less than its own solo value, compensated by an unattractive alternative).
Circulation, at `L = 1`, is confirmed a genuinely high-`n` device: at
`n = 2` it is neither implied by nor implies the class the capstone closed.

/-! ## The `L = 1` two-coordinate certificate, as a pure `λ`-mixing `Prop` -/

/-- **The `L = 1`, two-coordinate circulation certificate**, as a bare
existence statement: some distribution `λ` on `Bool` whose mix of the two
solo rows `v0 = r{false}`, `v1 = r{true}` dominates `floor` everywhere and
pins every coordinate its own player has positive weight on. This is exactly
what an `L = 1` `FaceCirculationCertificate` reduces to at `ι = Bool`
(`faceCirculationCertificate_one_bool_iff`), short of the weight-level
`solo_le_floor` axiom, which is orthogonal to the choice of `λ`. -/
def CirculationL1Feasible (v0 v1 floor : Bool → ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ lam : Bool → ℝ, 0 ≤ lam false ∧ 0 ≤ lam true ∧ lam false + lam true = 1 ∧

    (0 < lam false → lam false * v0 false + lam true * v1 false = v0 false) ∧
    (0 < lam true → lam false * v0 true + lam true * v1 true = v1 true)

`FaceCirculationCertificate` for `r` and `floor` exists iff `solo_le_floor`
holds and the two-coordinate mixing problem `CirculationL1Feasible` is
feasible for the solo rows `r{false}, r{true}`. The forward direction
solves `step`'s single equation for `vertex 0 = mixTarget r (mixWeight 0)`
(using `ratio_lt_one` to cancel `1 - ratio 0 ≠ 0`) and reads pinning off
`vertex_pinned`; the reverse direction builds the constant witness
`vertex := mixTarget r λ`, `mixWeight := λ`, `ratio := 1 / 2`. -/

/-! ## The two-coordinate closed form -/

/-- **The two-coordinate characterization.** `CirculationL1Feasible` is a
two-way disjunction: a pure witness at `false` (`floor ≤ v0` everywhere,
pinning at `false` being automatic since `v0 false = v0 false`) or a pure
witness at `true` (symmetric). A mixed witness `0 < λ_false, λ_true`
forces, from the two pinning equations, `v1 false = v0 false` and
`v0 true = v1 true` — i.e. `v0 = v1` outright — at which point it already
lies in the `false`-pure disjunct. So the mixed case adds nothing beyond
the pure disjuncts, unlike the singleton-LCP two-coordinate case, whose
mixed disjunct is a genuine third alternative. -/
