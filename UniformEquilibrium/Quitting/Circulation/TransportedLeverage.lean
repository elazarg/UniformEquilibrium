# Transported leverage: the corrected surgery currency

This development replaces the refuted `δ / ρ` seam-price law — the reading
that a re-closing's cost is priced by absorbed mass, in the tradition of the
cyclic-repair estimates of R. S. Simon, *The structure of non-zero-sum
stochastic games*, Adv. Appl. Math. 38 (2007), Lemma 4 — with a constructive
currency: what controls a local block modification `B` inside an array `G`
is not absorbed mass but **transported leverage** -- the modification's
effect on the block map, amplified by the contraction deficit of the return
map being re-closed.

This file names both leverage quantities as definitions over objects already
in the repository, proves the coarse absorption bound and the exact
re-closing identity for the value channel, states and proves the corrected
obstruction, exhibits the incomparability of "leverage" and "support size",
and records where the deviation channel's leverage is undefined.

## Verification against the repository's own objects

Every quantity the source names already has a home:

* `C_P`, the prefix transport factor, is `blockSurvival` of
  `QuittingSeamPriceResidual.lean` restricted to the prefix window;
* `ρ̃_G`, the post-modification full deficit, is `1 - blockSurvival` over the
  whole (modified) cycle;
* `Q_{P,i}`, the deviation prefix transport factor, is
  `quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight` of `QuittingCycleMismatchContraction.lean`
  restricted to the prefix;
* `1 - Q̃_{G,i}`, the deleted deficit, is `1 - quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight`
  over the whole (modified) cycle;
* the block deviation operator `H_{t,i}(w) = max {Σ_i, A_i + c_{-i} w}` is
  *exactly* `quittingRootCompanionMap`, and its multi-stage composite is
  *exactly* `quittingCompanionComposite` -- no new machinery is built for
  either.

No quantity had to be introduced that is not already one of these repository
objects; the abstract value-channel machinery (`blockValueMap`,
`blockConstant_add`) is new *composition algebra* over the existing
`blockSurvival` / `blockConstant` primitives, not a new modeling choice.

## Main definitions

* `blockValueMap` -- the block value map `Φ_B(z) = blockConstant + blockSurvival · z`,
  literally the transport law of `orbit_eq_blockSurvival_mul_add_blockConstant`
  read as a function of the boundary value.
* `valueLeverage` -- `L^val(B;G)`, deliverable (1), value channel.
* `quittingRootSystem` / `quittingRootCompanionMap_eq_quittingRootSystem_Φ` --
  the **crucial reuse**: the block deviation operator is the abstract
  max-affine system of `Math.MaxAffineStoppingValue`, at *every* root, not
  only isolated ones.
* `deviationLeverage` -- `L^dev_i(B;G)`, deliverable (1), deviation channel.

## Main results

* `valueLeverage_eq_mul_add_abs` -- the leverage's `sSup` definition agrees
  with its closed form, verifying (29).
* `valueLeverage_le_coarse_absorption_bound` -- deliverable (2), the coarse
  bound `L^val ≤ 2 C_P (ρ_B + ρ̃_B) / ρ̃_G`, reproducing (30).
* `sub_blockFixedPoint_eq_transportedLeverageTerm` -- the exact re-closing
  identity `ṽ - v = (C_P / ρ̃_G)(Φ̃_B(z) - Φ_B(z))`, reproducing (26), derived
  from the composition law `blockValueMap_add` and the existing
  `blockFixedPoint_isFixedPt` -- not re-imported as a hypothesis.
* `not_eventually_ge_of_tendsto_leverage_zero` -- deliverable (3), the
  corrected obstruction stated generically, directly usable as a no-go.
* `valueLeverage_smallSupport_eq_one` /
  `tendsto_valueLeverage_largeSupport_atTop_nhds_zero` -- deliverable (4),
  the incomparability witnesses.
* `one_sub_quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight_eq_zero_iff_isQuittingIsolatedWindow`
  -- the honesty finding: the deviation leverage's denominator vanishes
  *exactly* at the isolated configuration, the same `P = 1` regime fenced in
  `Math.MaxAffineStoppingValue`.

/-! ## Part 0: the block deviation operator is the max-affine system

`quittingRootCompanionMap` is *already* `max {A, T + P·w}` with
`A = Σ_who`, `T = A_who`, `P = c_{-who}` -- this is definitional, and no
isolation hypothesis is needed to see it.  `QuittingIsolatedAnchorMaxAffine.lean`
only records the special case `P = 1`; the general bridge below is the
"crucial reuse" the dispatch asks for. -/

support of size `1` can already carry leverage `1` (order-one); a support of
size `n → ∞` can carry leverage `(1/2)^n → 0`. -/

variable {ι' : Type} [Fintype ι'] [DecidableEq ι']

/-- **The deviation-channel transported leverage**, `L^dev_i(B;G)`,
deliverable (1).  The prefix deleted-survival transport factor `Q_{P,i}`,
divided by the post-modification **whole-window** deleted deficit
`1 - Q̃_{G,i}` -- a quantity of the enclosing array `G`, kept as an explicit
parameter rather than recomputed from `B`'s own `(start, fuel)` window, for
the same reason `valueLeverage` takes its `rhoTildeG` explicitly: `G` may be
strictly larger than `B` (`A2`) -- times the supremum over `w ∈ [-1, 1]` of
the discrepancy between the new and old block deviation operators over `B`'s
own window `[start, start + fuel)` -- `quittingCompanionComposite`, reused
without modification.  Meaningful only when `Q̃_{G,i} < 1`. -/

        quittingCompanionComposite reward roots who start fuel w|) '' Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1)

/-- **The honesty finding.**  The deviation leverage's denominator vanishes
*exactly* at the isolated configuration: `Q̃_{G,i} = 1` iff `who` is isolated
throughout the (post-modification) window `[0, fuel)`.  This is the same
`P = 1` regime `Math.MaxAffineStoppingValue.System`'s fence singles out
(`naiveClosedForm_eq_anchoredValue_iff_of_P_eq_one_of_T_eq_zero`): the
deviation leverage is undefined exactly where this program's obstructions --
the isolated coordinate of `QuittingSeamPriceDeviationFalsity` -- concentrate.
It is not merely large there; division by `1 - Q̃_{G,i}` is division by `0`,
and Lean's convention silently returns `0` rather than signaling the failure,
exactly as `naiveClosedForm_eq_anchoredValue_iff_of_P_eq_one_of_T_eq_zero`
warns for the value-channel closed form at `P = 1`. -/
