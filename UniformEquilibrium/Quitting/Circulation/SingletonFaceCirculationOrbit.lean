# Gluing the phases: orbits of unbounded quit mass from a circulation

`SingletonFaceCirculation.lean` proves the one-phase step: along the ideal
edge of a singleton-support phase, the microstep row `(1 - β) e_i` satisfies
the support-perfect condition at tolerance `2 M (1 - β)` and keeps the state
above the floor.  This file glues the phases into a single infinite forward
chain and reads off its quit mass.

The schedule is the obvious one: spend `N` microsteps in each phase, then
advance.  Because a singleton-support phase is traversed *exactly* -- the
state is `β^t z^ℓ + (1 - β^t) w({i_ℓ})` and the phase ends at
`β^N z^ℓ + (1 - β^N) w({i_ℓ}) = α_ℓ z^ℓ + (1 - α_ℓ) w({i_ℓ}) = z^{ℓ+1}` --
the chain closes on the ideal cycle with no error and no fixed-point
correction.

Consequently the whole chain lives in the `2 M (1 - β)`-support-perfect
correspondence, stays above the floor forever, and releases quit mass
`1 - β` per microstep, so any prescribed total quit mass is reached by a
long enough finite prefix.

## Contents

* `phaseSchedule`, `phaseSchedule_snd_lt`: the microstep schedule and its
  invariant.
* `SingletonSupport`: the point-mass presentation of a certificate's phases.
* `circulationRow`, `circulationState`, `circulationState_succ`: the chain
  and its one-stage recursion `R_{n+1} = f(R_n, x_n)`.
* `circulationState_ge_floor`, `isSupportPerfectRow_circulation`,
  `isWeightedRow_circulation`: rationality and the one-stage inequalities.
* `exists_prefix_quitMass_ge`: for every target `Q` a finite prefix of the
  chain has quit mass at least `Q`.

## Reading the chain as an orbit

The chain runs forward, `R_{n+1} = f(R_n, x_n)`; the backward orbit
convention of the source question is obtained by reversing a finite prefix,
`r^{(t)} = R_{m - t}`, which turns `circulationState_succ` into
`r^{(t)} = f(r^{(t+1)}, x^{(t)})` with no change of content.  Feasibility of
the states is inherited from the certificate's vertices, which is a property
of the certificate and is not re-derived here.
