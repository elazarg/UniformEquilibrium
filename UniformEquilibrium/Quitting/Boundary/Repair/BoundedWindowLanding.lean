# The survival-window landing against the bounded granted predicate

`QuittingSurvivalWindowLanding.lean` states its no-large-jump step against
`IsQuittingGrantedContinueMassBound`, a predicate quantified over *all*
continuation vectors dominating the reservation level.  What
`QuittingWeightedContinueMassBound.lean` actually proves is the weaker
`IsQuittingBoundedGrantedContinueMassBound`, carrying one extra clause: the
continuation vector is uniformly bounded.  The gap between the two is the
only thing separating the landing chain from an unconditional consumer of
the weighted continue-mass theorem.

This file closes it.  The continuation the landing feeds to the granted
predicate is the *lift*

> `quittingLiftedContinuation _ = max (plan's continuation value) (reservation)`,

a coordinatewise maximum of two bounded quantities: the plan's own terminal
value is bounded by the reward bound
(`abs_quittingRootSequenceTerminalValue_le`), and the reservation vector is a
parameter, bounded by assumption.  So the lift is bounded, the bounded
predicate applies verbatim, and every theorem of the landing chain is
re-proved against it.

## The reservation bound is not an artefact

`|reservation| ≤ bound` costs nothing where the chain is used: the
reservation level is a punishment level of a game whose rewards are bounded
by `bound`, and the two hypotheses that mention it pin it from both sides --
`IsStationaryPunishment` caps each player there from above, and
`IsQuittingConditionalReservation` says each player can secure it from
below.  Both are compatible with `|reservation| ≤ bound`; neither implies it,
so it is stated.

## Main results

* `abs_quittingLiftedContinuation_le` -- the lift is bounded
* `le_quittingStationaryContinueMass_of_le_jointSurvivalWeight_of_bounded` --
  the no-large-jump lemma, against the bounded predicate
* `exists_jointSurvivalWeight_mem_survivalWindow_of_bounded` -- the landing
* `exists_pos_ratio_forall_exists_jointSurvivalWeight_mem_survivalWindow` --
  the composition with the weighted continue-mass theorem: no instant
  approximate equilibria plus a stationary punishment plus bounded rewards
  give a positive ratio at which every global `ε`-equilibrium plan's
  survival sequence visits the window, with no unproved predicate left in
  the hypothesis list

/-- **The no-large-jump lemma, bounded form.**  Granted only the *bounded*
per-stage continue-mass bound, a globally `ε`-optimal plan still cannot lose
more than the factor `ratio` at a stage whose joint survival is at least
`ε / ratio`.

The lift supplies the missing clause for free: it dominates the reservation
level by construction and is bounded because both of the quantities it
maximises are. -/

/-! ## The composition with the weighted continue-mass theorem -/

/-- **The landing with no unproved predicate left.**  A reward with no
instant approximate equilibria and a stationary punishment at every player
admits a positive `ratio` such that *every* globally `ε`-optimal plan whose
continuation vector is secured by the reservation level, and whose joint
survival ever drops to `window`, has a stage in the closed window
`[ratio * window, window]`.

The granted per-stage bound is no longer a hypothesis: it is supplied by
`exists_pos_isQuittingBoundedGrantedContinueMassBound`, and the bounded form
is exactly what the landing chain consumes above.  What remains in the
hypothesis list is the input data -- the plan, its global accuracy, and the
reservation level's two sides -- and nothing that is merely granted. -/
