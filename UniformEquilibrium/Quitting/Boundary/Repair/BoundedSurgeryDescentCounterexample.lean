# Zero-pinned finite chains cannot uniformly decrement their optimized debt

This is the explicit two-player table from the descent-refutation record.  For
a parameter `0 < a < 1`,

`r({1}) = (a, 0)`, `r({2}) = (1, -1)`, `r({1, 2}) = (0, 1)`.

## What this module shows

Restrict attention to the *zero-boundary* exact Nash--Bellman chain family:
finite chains whose terminal continuation is pinned to `0`, padded beyond the
cutoff by the positive singleton debt cap.  On this table that family is a
singleton at every cutoff `m`: at every backward step the stage game has a
unique Nash equilibrium, in which player two mixes half--half and player one
mixes with a hazard depending on the current tail.  The resulting value
sequence and the resulting exact dynamic debt both have exact closed forms,

`x_k = a(1 - a^k) / (1 - a^(k+1))`, `d_m = a(1 - a) / (1 - a^(m+1))`,

where `x_k` is player one's displayed payoff at reverse distance `k` from the
zero boundary and `d_m` is player one's exact dynamic debt at cutoff `m`
(player two's debt is forced to zero at every cutoff, since its terminal
singleton cap is zero).  Since the family is a singleton, `d_m` is exactly the
optimized (min-max) debt at cutoff `m`, not merely a witnessed upper bound.
The sequence `d_m` never falls below the strictly positive plateau `a(1 - a)`,
and for every fixed extra horizon length `L` the drop `d_m - d_{m+L}` tends to
zero as `m → ∞`.  **Within the zero-pinned chain family, no bounded-length
extension can decrement the optimized debt by a cutoff-independent amount.**

## What this module does not show

This is not evidence that the underlying two-player game is hard, or that it
lacks an equilibrium.  The game has an explicit exact **stationary**
equilibrium with **zero** debt: player one quits with probability `1/2` at
every stage, player two never quits, giving terminal payoff `(a, 0)`.  Both
players are exactly indifferent against that continuation: player one's
Quit endpoint is `a` and its Continue endpoint is also `a` (against the
constant continuation `a`), while player two's Quit endpoint is
`2 * (1/2) - 1 = 0` and its Continue endpoint is `(1/2) * 0 = 0` (against the
constant continuation `0`).  See `stationaryRoot_isEndpointNash` below, an
exact (`ε = 0`) endpoint-Nash certificate, not merely an approximate one.

The positive plateau `d_m → a(1 - a)` is manufactured entirely by pinning the
terminal continuation to `0` rather than to the game's own equilibrium value
`(a, 0)`.  Pinning to `0` forces a strictly positive gap `a - 0 = a` at every
finite horizon between the singleton cap and the true continuation; that gap
forces the opponent's survival product strictly below `1` at every step
(since player one must mix, not play a corner action, to stay indifferent
against a nonzero tail), which is exactly what manufactures the debt.  Using
the constant continuation `(a, 0)` instead of `0` erases the gap and, with
it, the debt: see `quittingConstantDynamicDebt_eq_zero` below, which computes
the same debt recursion against the honest continuation `(a, 0)` and gets
`0` at every horizon.  The result therefore bounds the zero-pinned finite-
chain *method*, not the game.

the exact same dynamic-debt Bellman recursion used above, but against the
game's own stationary continuation `(a, 0)` instead of the zero-boundary
pin, and with the honest terminal debt `0` instead of the positive
singleton cap: the debt is exactly zero at every horizon.  Contrast
`chainPath_dynamicDebt_false_eq`, whose zero-pinned debt is the strictly
positive `d_m`. -/
