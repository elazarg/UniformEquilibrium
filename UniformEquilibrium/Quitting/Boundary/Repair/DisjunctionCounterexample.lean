# A weight outside both disjuncts of the finite-quitting reduction

`QuittingZeroSoloDisjunct.lean` reduces the existence of a uniform
equilibrium payoff to the disjunction

    `IsQuittingZeroSolo reward ∨ HasAdmissibleAbsorbingQuittingCycle reward`.

Whether that disjunction is *exhaustive* was once recorded in this repository
as an open declaration.  It is not: this file exhibits a two-coordinate weight
satisfying neither branch, machine-checked.

## The weight

With `false` for coordinate `1` and `true` for coordinate `2`,

    `r({1}) = (1, -1)`,  `r({2}) = (1, -1)`,  `r({1,2}) = (0, 1)`.

Note `r_1({1}) = 1 > 0`, so the weight is not zero-solo: the first disjunct
fails at once (`not_isQuittingZeroSolo_reward`).

The second disjunct fails for a subtler reason.  *Absorbing complementary
cycles do exist here*: the single row in which coordinate `2` quits surely and
coordinate `1` is silent, run against the value `(1, -1)`, is an
`IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` (`witnessBlock_isCyclicContinuationBlock`).
What fails is admissibility.  At that row coordinate `1` never quits, so the
deleted survival product at coordinate `2` is `1`, and `r_2({2}) = -1 < 0`;
by `quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_eq_of_isolated` the anchored
companion mismatch is exactly `1` (`witness_mismatch_eq_one`), not `0`.

Moreover this is not an accident of the chosen row.  *Every* absorbing
complementary cycle for this weight, of every period, has coordinate `1`
silent at every phase (`isQuittingIsolatedWindow_of_cyclicContinuationBlock`),
so no cycle is admissible and the second disjunct fails outright
(`not_hasAdmissibleAbsorbingQuittingCycle_reward`).

## Why coordinate `1` must be silent

Write `p_k`, `q_k` for the two quit probabilities at phase `k` and put
`v_k = z_k(2) + 1`, the coordinate-`2` value shifted by `-r_2({1}) = 1`.  The
one-stage law becomes

    `v_k = 2 p_k q_k + (1 - p_k)(1 - q_k) v_{k+1}`,

whose stop term `2 p_k` is nonnegative and strictly positive exactly when
coordinate `1` is active.  Coordinate `2`'s two exact-Nash complementarity
clauses read off as `2 p_k ≤ v_k` and `(1 - p_k) v_{k+1} ≤ v_k`; the first
forces `v_k ≤ (1 - p_k) v_{k+1}` whenever `q_k < 1`.  And `q_k = 1` is
impossible while coordinate `1` is active, because `r_1({1,2}) = 0 < 1 =
r_1({2})`: against a surely-quitting opponent, quitting costs coordinate `1`
exactly `1`.  So each phase with `p_k > 0` *strictly increases* `v`, and `v`
never decreases; a cycle returns `v` to its starting value, which no strict
increase permits.

## What this does not say

Nothing here claims this weight has no uniform equilibrium payoff — it has two
coordinates, and one exists by other means.  The claim is only that the weight
lies outside the *carrier* of the stated disjunction, so the disjunction is not
exhaustive and cannot be upgraded to an unconditional existence theorem as it
stands.

`HEADLINE` — the permanent regression against restating the disjunction
`IsQuittingZeroSolo ∨ HasAdmissibleAbsorbingQuittingCycle` as a theorem about
every weight: the two-coordinate weight `r({1}) = r({2}) = (1, -1)`,
`r({1,2}) = (0, 1)` satisfies neither branch.  It refutes exactly the
*completeness of this carrier*, so
`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_zeroSolo_or_admissibleCycle` cannot be
upgraded to an unconditional existence theorem by discharging its hypothesis.
It does **not** claim that this weight has no uniform equilibrium payoff — it
has two coordinates and one exists by other means; nor does it say anything
about weights outside the exhibited one. -/
