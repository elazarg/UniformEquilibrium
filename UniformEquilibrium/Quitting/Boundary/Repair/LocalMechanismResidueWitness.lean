# A parametric three-player local-mechanism residue

The reward table `reward L` extends the switching-residue regression table:
at `L = 0` the two tables agree, while increasing `L` changes player `1`'s
payoff at `{0,2}` and `{0,1,2}`.  For `L > 18/5`, the resulting table escapes
all four local mechanisms considered here:

* every solo-owner rate is blocked (`K1`);
* every nonempty sure exit set fails (`K2`);
* every ordered one-owner/sure-blocker collision repair fails (`K3`), in the
  actual semantic `QuittingCollisionRepairWorks` predicate and therefore
  independently of how the exact punishment floor is computed;
* every interior two-owner/one-sure-blocker root fails (`K4`).  For blocker
  `1` the two mixer indifferences force rates `(1/2, 1/3)`, and the blocker's
  quit-minus-continue residual is exactly `(18 - 5L)/90`; the other two
  blocker choices force one mixer to the boundary.

Nevertheless every member of the family has an exact absorbing stationary
equilibrium:
players `0` and `2` quit surely and player `1` quits with probability `2/7`.
Its terminal payoff is `(5/7, L, 2/7)`.  Thus these four mechanisms are not
exhaustive: the residue is absorbed by the omitted **double-sure mixer** cell,
which is covered by the general sure-set/owner engine.

The concrete rational witness is `L = 4`.
