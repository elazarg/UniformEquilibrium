# A three-player obstruction to sure-set owner repair

This file isolates the first genuinely multi-player gap in the
positive-debt repair program.  At the uniform three-player zero-tail root,
player zero has positive exact cutoff-one debt.  Its positive terminal
packet is carried by the full opponent set `{1, 2}`, and every positive
owner-solo rate has a joining obstruction.  Nevertheless no nonempty sure
quitting set satisfies all zero-hazard limiting credibility inequalities:
the singleton sets fail the owner's inequality, while `{1, 2}` has an
internal leaver.

This is only a counterexample to the implication

`positive packet + universal owner-solo obstruction -> sure-set repair`.

It does not establish a positive optimized debt plateau, exclude other
stationary or nonstationary repairs, or give a global nonexistence theorem.
In fact, the sure coalition `{0,1}` is an exact direct First certificate;
this is proved explicitly below.
