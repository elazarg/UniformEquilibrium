# The pinned-pure decoupling lemma

A certificate-search sweep found this structural fact empirically: at a row `x` with one
coordinate pinned pure (`x k = 1`), every other coordinate's continuation term vanishes,
so its `gainValue` becomes independent of the continuation ("next-phase") value entirely,
and the exact-complementarity conditions at the row collapse from a system coupling every
coordinate to `next` into a family of purely algebraic, per-coordinate conditions. This
file makes that fact a theorem in the real-hazard encoding of
`QuittingCyclicWeightRowDichotomy`: `sigmaValue`, `gammaValue`, `gainValue` over a general
finite index type `ι`, specialized where needed to the explicit rational weight
`cyclicWeight` on three cyclically ordered coordinates.

## Contents

* `continueMassExcl_eq_zero_of_pinned`, `gammaValue_eq_excludedValue_of_pinned`,
  `gainValue_eq_sigma_sub_excluded_of_pinned`, `gainValue_pinned_indep_next`: the
  decoupling, for a general finite `ι` and a general weight `r` (goal 1).
* `single_coordinate_condition_iff`: the univariate solvability characterization of the
  single-coordinate exact-complementarity condition against a fixed gain value -- its
  solution set is a point, an interval, or empty, according to the sign of the gain
  (goal 2's general half).
* `isExactRowComplementary_iff_of_pinned`: the whole-row exact-complementarity condition,
  at a pinned-pure row, reduces to the pinned coordinate's own condition together with the
  independent per-coordinate conditions at every other coordinate (goal 2's row-level
  reduction).
* `gainValue_cyclicWeight_pinned_of_pred`, `gainValue_cyclicWeight_pinned_of_succ`: the
  explicit affine formulas for `cyclicWeight`'s decoupled gain, with coefficients read off
  the weight table (goal 1's explicit half).
* `cyclicWeight_pinned_pred_condition_iff`, `cyclicWeight_pinned_succ_condition_iff`: the
  explicit solvability characterization for `cyclicWeight`'s two coordinate shapes
  (goal 2's explicit half).
* `gainValue_cyclicWeight_pinned_succ_eq_zero_iff`: the genericity corollary -- the
  boundary of the succ-pinned univariate condition sits at the single rational point
  `3 / 7`, an explicitly bounded denominator (goal 3).
* `cyclicPred_cyclicSucc`, `not_isExactRowComplementary_cyclicWeight_of_pinned`: for
  `cyclicWeight` specifically, chaining the two coordinate-shape formulas around the row
  shows the pinned coordinate's own condition is always violated, so no exactly
  complementary row of `cyclicWeight` has any coordinate pinned to `1` at all (a corollary
  of goals 1 and 2 together, independent of the next-phase value's sign).

/-- **Decoupling, step one.** If coordinate `k` is pinned pure (`x k = 1`), then for every
other coordinate `i ≠ k`, the deleted continue mass `c_{-i}(x)` vanishes: `k` is one of the
coordinates other than `i`, and its survival factor `1 - x k` is one of the factors in the
product, so the whole product is `0`. -/

continuation term entirely: it equals the nonempty-coalition value `A_i`, regardless of
the continuation ("next-phase") value fed in. -/

expression built entirely from the row's other coordinates through the weight table `r`,
with no reference to the continuation value at all. -/

/-- **The univariate solvability characterization.** Fix a coordinate value `x0 ∈ [0,1]`
and a gain `g`. The single-coordinate exact-complementarity condition
`(0 < x0 → 0 ≤ g) ∧ (x0 < 1 → g ≤ 0)` holds iff `g` is positive and `x0` is pinned to `1`,
or `g` is negative and `x0` is pinned to `0`, or `g` is exactly `0` (in which case `x0` is
unconstrained). Since the condition, for fixed `g`, is affine (indeed constant) in `x0`,
its solution set is always a single point (`{1}` or `{0}`) or the whole interval `[0,1]`
-- an interval, a point, or (when `g`'s sign is unattainable for the given bounds, though
that cannot happen here since `x0 ∈ [0,1]` is nonempty) empty. -/

reduces to: the pinned coordinate's own condition (only `0 ≤ g k` survives, since
`x k = 1` is never `< 1`), conjoined with the ordinary two-sided condition at every other
coordinate -- independent conditions, one per coordinate, since (by the decoupling above)
each `g i` for `i ≠ k` no longer references the continuation value. -/

/-! ## The explicit rational weight: affine coefficients from the table -/

/-- **Goal 1, explicit form: the pred-pinned coordinate.** If `i`'s predecessor is pinned
pure, `gainValue` at `i` collapses to the constant `-1`, independent of both the
continuation value and of `i`'s remaining free neighbor `x (cyclicSucc i)`: the weight
table's contribution from the successor's hazard is itself killed by the vanishing
`(1 - x (cyclicPred i))` factor in equation (15). -/

    (hk : x (cyclicPred i) = 1) (next : ℝ) :
    gainValue cyclicWeight x i next = -1 := by
  rw [gainValue_cyclicWeight, hk]; ring

/-- **Goal 1, explicit form: the succ-pinned coordinate.** If `i`'s successor is pinned
pure, `gainValue` at `i` collapses to the affine function `3/4 - (7/4) * x (cyclicPred i)`
of the single remaining free coordinate, with coefficients read directly off equation (15)
once `x (cyclicSucc i) = 1` is substituted. -/

  rw [gainValue_cyclicWeight, hk]; ring

/-- **Goal 2, explicit form: the pred-pinned coordinate's condition.** Combining
`gainValue_cyclicWeight_pinned_of_pred` with `single_coordinate_condition_iff`: since the
collapsed gain is the negative constant `-1`, the single-coordinate condition at `i` holds
iff `x i = 0` -- unconditionally, for any value of the remaining free neighbor. -/

/-- **Goal 2, explicit form: the succ-pinned coordinate's condition.** Combining
`gainValue_cyclicWeight_pinned_of_succ` with `single_coordinate_condition_iff`: the
single-coordinate condition at `i` holds iff the remaining free hazard
`x (cyclicPred i)` and `x i` satisfy exactly one of three mutually exclusive cases --
free hazard below `3/7` and `i` pinned active; free hazard above `3/7` and `i` pinned
inert; or free hazard exactly `3/7`, leaving `x i` unconstrained. The solution set for
`x (cyclicPred i)` under each target value of `x i` is correspondingly a half-open
interval or a single point: never anything more complicated, since the governing
condition is affine. -/

/-! ## Goal 3: the genericity corollary -/

/-- **Genericity corollary.** In the succ-pinned case, `gainValue` at `i` vanishes --
leaving `x i` unconstrained by the single-coordinate condition -- exactly when the
remaining free hazard `x (cyclicPred i)` hits the single rational point `3/7`. The
weight table's entries have denominators dividing `4`; combining the `3/4` and `1`
(from `-p`) coefficients of the affine map `p ↦ 3/4 - (7/4) p` through equation (15)
produces a boundary point of denominator `7`, not some larger denominator accumulated
from iterating the construction: whenever the succ-pinned univariate condition is
solvable at its boundary, it is solvable at this one explicit, bounded-denominator
point. -/

  constructor <;> intro h <;> linarith

/-! ## A further corollary: no pinned-pure row of `cyclicWeight` is exactly complementary -/

/-- `π` is also a right inverse of `σ` on the three-cycle (the source file only records
`cyclicSucc_cyclicPred`, the left inverse). Used to identify "`i`'s predecessor is `k`"
from "`i` is `k`'s successor". -/
theorem cyclicPred_cyclicSucc (i : CyclicIndex) : cyclicPred (cyclicSucc i) = i := by
  fin_cases i <;> decide

/-- **A further corollary of goals 1 and 2, for `cyclicWeight` specifically.** Chain the
two coordinate-shape formulas around the pinned coordinate `k`: the successor of `k` is
forced inert (its own condition is the constant `-1`), which forces the predecessor of `k`
active (its condition becomes `3/4 - 0 = 3/4 > 0`) -- and then `k`'s own condition, which
is *not* decoupled from the continuation value, evaluates via `gainValue_cyclicWeight` to
`-1` from these two forced neighbor values, violating `0 ≤ g k`. So no exactly
complementary row of `cyclicWeight` has any coordinate pinned to `1`, for any next-phase
value `z` whatsoever (unlike `atMostOnePositive_of_isExactRowComplementary`, this needs no
`0 ≤ z j` hypothesis, precisely because the decoupled coordinates' conditions never see
`z`). This shows, in this one instance, that admissibility -- consistency with the
*other* coordinates' forced values and with the pinned coordinate's own, non-decoupled
condition -- rather than solvability of any single univariate condition in isolation, is
what rules the row out. -/

/-! ## Consequence for the periodic argument (docstring only, not a theorem)

The sweep's broader point is not formalized here as a theorem, since it concerns the
surrounding periodic argument built outside this file: whether an exactly complementary
period-one row can pass through a pinned-pure configuration `x k = 1` is governed
entirely by the univariate conditions above. Each remaining coordinate's condition,
once decoupled from the continuation value, is a single affine constraint (for
`cyclicWeight`, literally affine in one real variable) -- so its solvability is a
closed-form question with an explicit boundary, not a search problem. This is why, at
period one, **admissibility is the discriminating filter, not existence**: a univariate
condition being individually solvable (as the succ-pinned one always is, e.g. at the
boundary `x (cyclicPred i) = 3/7`, or by taking the free hazard below/above it) does not
by itself produce a valid row. The row also has to reconcile that per-coordinate solution
with every other coordinate's forced value and with the pinned coordinate's own,
non-decoupled condition -- and, one level up in the periodic construction that this file
does not build, with fitting into a consistent cycle across phases at all. For
`cyclicWeight` specifically that reconciliation always fails
(`not_isExactRowComplementary_cyclicWeight_of_pinned`), but the shape of the
argument -- decouple, solve each univariate condition in closed form, then check
consistency -- is the general pattern the sweep found, independent of which weight
table is in play.
