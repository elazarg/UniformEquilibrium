# Joint infinite-horizon complementarity for quitting games

Every landed complementarity notion in this tree is either single-coordinate
(`IsQuittingLivePrescribedValue`, `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash`) or periodic
(`IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`).  Neither can state "every complementary
sequence": an arbitrary infinite row sequence `x : ℕ → ι → PMF Bool`, not
periodic, not finite-support.  This file supplies that joint,
infinite-horizon notion, built from the existing single-stage machinery
`quittingFixedOpponentsQuitValue`, `quittingFixedOpponentsContinueReward`,
`quittingFixedOpponentsContinueMass`.

## Contents

* `quittingJointSurvivalWeight`: the probability that nobody quits over a
  finite window, for an arbitrary root sequence.  A thin `start`-indexed
  wrapper over the existing `quittingFiniteContinueWeight`.
* `quittingComplementarityTailValue`: the tail value `V i t`, an absolutely
  convergent series (Deliverable 1).  Convergence needs only a bounded
  reward table -- automatic here since `ι` is a `Fintype` -- and no further
  hypothesis: the survival weights telescope regardless of whether the
  sequence eventually absorbs.
* `quittingComplementarityStageGap` and `IsQuittingJointComplementary`: the
  stage gap and the joint complementarity predicate.
* `isQuittingJointComplementary_quittingCyclicBlockRoots`: the compatibility
  bridge from a periodic `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`.
* `IsQuittingUpperComplementaryAt` and `IsQuittingLowerComplementaryAt`: the
  minimal one-coordinate, single-clause hypotheses whose conjunction (at one
  coordinate) is exactly `IsQuittingJointComplementary` restricted to that
  coordinate.  `IsQuittingUpperComplementaryAt` alone is strictly weaker and
  is what Deliverable 2 actually consumes, so it also covers unilateral
  best-response tails, one-sided `ε`-equilibria, and non-equilibrium plans.
* `quittingJointSurvivalWeight_tendsto_zero_of_isQuittingUpperComplementaryAt_of_solo_pos`
  and `isCompletelyAbsorbing_of_isQuittingUpperComplementaryAt_of_solo_pos`:
  Deliverable 2, absorption forced by a positive solo reward, from the
  minimal hypothesis.  `..._of_isQuittingJointComplementary_of_solo_pos`
  versions of both are kept as corollaries under the full joint predicate.

Only the sub-certain-quit ("upper") clause of `IsQuittingJointComplementary`'s
two clauses, and only at the single coordinate `i` -- not the positive-quit
clause, and not any other coordinate's clauses at all.  Strictly weaker than
joint complementarity restricted to `i`, so it also covers, e.g., a
unilateral best-response tail for `i` alone, a one-sided `ε`-equilibrium at
`i`, or any non-equilibrium plan that merely never leaves a positive stage
gap at a sub-certain quit for `i` -- none of which satisfy the full joint
predicate. -/

/-- **Deliverable 2: absorption is forced by a positive solo reward, from the
minimal upper-clause hypothesis alone.**  If the sub-certain-quit stage-gap
clause holds at coordinate `i` (`IsQuittingUpperComplementaryAt`) and `i`'s
solo-quit reward is strictly positive, play absorbs almost surely from every
starting time -- no hypothesis at any other coordinate, and no positive-quit
clause at `i` either.

Proof idea: suppose not, from some `t`.  Then the joint survival weight from
`t` has a positive limit `L`, hence so does the coarser opponent-only
survival weight for `i` (joint `≤` opponent, pointwise).  Positive opponent
survival forces the opponent continue mass to one and, through the
exceptional-clock estimates, the quit value to the solo reward and the
continue reward to zero.  It also forces the tail value itself to vanish
(`abs_quittingComplementarityTailValue_le_of_tendsto`, using that positive
survival makes the *surviving* mass bound shrink to zero) -- this is the
step flagged in the design sketch as needing care about the other
coordinates, and it closes because the tail-value bound is against the
*joint* survival limit, which the opponent-only argument shows also tends to
one from `t`.  So the stage gap for `i` tends to the strictly positive solo
reward, and is eventually positive, hence eventually strictly above the
upper clause's threshold.  Since the clause only *forces* a nonpositive gap
when the quit probability is sub-certain, a positive gap there forces `i`'s
quit probability to be exactly one at that stage, so the joint continue mass
there is exactly zero, and the joint survival weight is eventually exactly
zero -- contradicting a positive limit. -/
