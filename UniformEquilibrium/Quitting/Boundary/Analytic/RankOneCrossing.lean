# Abstract rank-one crossing alternative for quitting plans

This module records the stochastic route corresponding to Simon's Case 1
when the one-stage support witness has been forgotten.

It is intentionally abstract.  The main theorem assumes both pieces that a
game-specific rank-one decision process would have to provide:

* every live history at the proposed ledger trigger has already produced a
  score crossing; and
* the adaptive decision process has a uniform expected-variation budget.

Under those assumptions the weak-L² maximal inequality bounds the prescribed
joint probability of reaching the trigger.  A separate exact survival identity
then converts that joint bound into the deleted opponent-survival bound needed
against a never-quit deviation:

`joint survival = opponent survival * own prescribed survival`.

Thus a joint reach bound `(ε / M)^2`, together with own prescribed survival at
least `ε / M`, gives deleted reach at most `ε / M`.

No theorem in the support-witness compiler depends on this module.  Retaining
the actual support witness gives the stronger deterministic clock-collapse
argument in `QuittingSupportWitnessClockCollapse`.  Conversely, this file does
not construct Simon's rank-one decision-discrepancy process, prove its crossing
implication, or establish its variation budget; it is an abstract consumer
theorem for an alternative route where those data are available.
