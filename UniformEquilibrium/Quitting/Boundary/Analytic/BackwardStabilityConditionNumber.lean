# The lens identity, leg one: the backward condition number is the weighted-
# to-unweighted conversion factor

Three quantities in the exact-vs-relaxed-cycle program are conjectured to be
one phenomenon: the backward-stability condition number (S1,
`QuittingRootEndpointBackwardStability.lean`), the lock margin, and
the `ε`-bridge's weighted-gain weakness at extreme hazards
(`QuittingRelaxedHazardRowBridge.lean`'s
`exists_weighted_bound_not_isεRowComplementary`). This file proves the first
leg: the backward condition number and the weighted-to-unweighted conversion
factor are not merely analogous, they are *the same arithmetic step* applied
to *the same pair of inequalities*.

## The mechanism

A single `who`-clause of `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash` is exactly the pair
`y * g ≤ ε` and `-ε ≤ x * g`, where `x = (root who true).toReal` is the Quit
probability, `y = (root who false).toReal` the Continue probability, and `g`
the raw (unweighted) endpoint gap `quittingRootEndpointDifference`. Reading
these as bounds on the *weighted* quantities `x * g`/`y * g`, recovering a
bound on the *raw* `g` itself costs dividing by `x` or `y` -- exactly the
same division that produces
`exists_exact_of_isεQuittingRootEndpointNash`'s shift bound
`|d i| * min x y ≤ ε`. `abs_le_div_min_of_weighted_bounds` isolates this
division as a standalone real-number fact, independent of any root/reward
machinery, with the resulting factor `1 / min x y`.

## Contents

* `abs_le_div_min_of_weighted_bounds`: the raw real-number conversion
  lemma -- weighted bounds at tolerance `ε` on a pair `(x, g)` with
  `x, y > 0` force `|g| ≤ ε / min x y`.
* `abs_quittingRootEndpointDifference_le_div_min_of_isεQuittingRootEndpointNash`:
  instantiated at a root Nash row, giving the same conversion factor
  `1 / min x y` for the raw endpoint gap.
* `exists_exact_ownShift_abs_eq_abs_quittingRootEndpointDifference`: **the
  headline.** At an interior coordinate, E64's own-set shift magnitude and
  the raw endpoint gap controlled by the conversion factor are *equal*, not
  merely bounded by the same formula -- so the backward condition number and
  the weighted-to-unweighted conversion factor coincide as literal real
  numbers, both `= ε / min x y`, at the *same* witness.
* `min_lt_inv_of_exists_weighted_bound_not_isεRowComplementary`: the
  conversion factor applied to `QuittingRelaxedHazardRowBridge.lean`'s
  reverse-bridge-failure witness. The witness's hazard is forced below
  `1 / εRow` -- the same `1/m` blowup that makes E64's condition number
  diverge at a near-pure row *is* the reason the reverse `ε`-bridge
  direction cannot be salvaged at any fixed row tolerance: it is not a
  coincidence of formulas, it is the conversion factor witnessing its own
  necessity.

## Scope

Period-one / fixed-tail only, matching `QuittingRootEndpointBackwardStability
.lean`'s scope. The other two legs of the three-lens identity -- the lock
margin and a general account of the `ε`-bridge's weighted-gain
weakness beyond this one witness family -- remain open; only S1's condition
number and the conversion factor are connected here.

/-! ## The raw conversion lemma -/

/-- **The weighted-to-unweighted conversion factor is `1 / min x y`.** If a
pair `(x, g)` obeys the two weighted inequalities that make up a single
clause of `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash` -- `y * g ≤ ε` and `-ε ≤ x * g` --
for `x, y > 0`, then the raw value `g` itself is controlled by `ε` divided
by `min x y`. This is exactly the division step inside
`exists_exact_of_isεQuittingRootEndpointNash`'s interior-coordinate
magnitude bound, extracted as a standalone real-number fact. -/

/-! ## The headline: the shift magnitude and the conversion bound coincide -/

/-- **The lens identity, leg one.** At an interior coordinate, the own-set
shift magnitude `exists_exact_of_isεQuittingRootEndpointNash` produces and
the raw endpoint gap the conversion factor controls are the *same real
number* up to sign, hence bounded by the *same instantiated value* of
`ε / min x y` -- not merely by the same formula. The equality
`|d who| = |quittingRootEndpointDifference reward tail root who|` is derived
purely from the shift theorem's public interface (its exactness clause plus
`quittingRootEndpointDifference_ownShiftReward`), with no appeal to the
specific witness `d` the existential proof constructs. -/

/-! ## The other side: the reverse-bridge witness is forced through the same
factor -/

/-- **The reverse `ε`-bridge failure is the same blowup as the backward
condition number.** `QuittingRelaxedHazardRowBridge.lean`'s
`exists_weighted_bound_not_isεRowComplementary` witnesses, for every row
tolerance `εRow`, a weighted-bound-respecting pair `(x, g)` with `g < -εRow`.
Feeding that witness through `abs_le_div_min_of_weighted_bounds` shows this
is not a free construction: the witnessing margin `min x (1 - x)` is forced
below `1 / εRow`, the exact reciprocal-condition-number threshold. So the
reverse direction's failure at every fixed tolerance and E64's condition
number blowup as the row approaches a pure endpoint are the same
phenomenon, read through the same inequality. -/
