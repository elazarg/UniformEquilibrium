# A completely absorbing inverse iterate with unbounded values

## The claim this file fences

An *inverse iterate* for a quitting weight is an `IsQuittingInverseIterate`:
rows `y t` and values `z t` with `z t = F_{y t}(z (t+1))` and `(y t, z (t+1))`
complementary at every time.  Its survival product is `∏_t c(y t)`, and it is
*completely absorbing* when that product is `0`.  The claim

> this weight admits no completely absorbing inverse iterate,

**stated with no boundedness condition on the values**, is
`NoCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate`.  This file refutes it for an explicit
three-coordinate weight, for every value of the weight's parameter `η ≥ 0`.

## Relation to the source

E. Solan, *The dynamics of the Nash correspondence and `n`-player stochastic
games*, Int. Game Theory Rev. **3**(4), 291–299 (2001),
doi:10.1142/S0219198901000488, Theorem 2.1: for every
`ε > 0` sufficiently small, `F_ε` contains only trivial vectors.  There an
*admissible sequence* is exactly an `IsQuittingInverseIterate`, *completely
absorbing* is exactly `IsCompletelyAbsorbing`, `F_ε` is the set of first
elements of admissible sequences, and `y ∈ F_ε` is *trivial* when no admissible
sequence for it is completely absorbing.  The game `G_ε` of its Figure 1 is
the table below multiplied by `3` on all seven entries, with `η = ε`.  So the
statement matches, and **no boundedness hypothesis appears in it**.

Its proof runs through display (1), `Σ_i y_i ≤ 4` and `0 ≤ y_i ≤ 3` — the
convex hull of the terminal payoffs — asserted for non-trivial `y` on the
ground that a completely absorbing admissible sequence makes `y(1)` the
*equilibrium payoff* of the induced profile.  That step needs the homogeneous
boundary term to vanish, which needs the values bounded.  The witness below is
a machine-checked instance where it does not: in the source's scaling it is
`y = (1, 3, 1 + η p)`, whose coordinate sum `5 + η p` exceeds the `4` of
display (1), and its induced profile is not an equilibrium of `G_ε` because
the third player receives `0` and can profit by quitting.

So the literal statement is false and the unstated hypothesis is boundedness;
the theorem's intended content is the bounded form, which its proof
establishes and which nothing here touches.

## What is and is not refuted

**The witness constructed here has unbounded values.**  Its third value
coordinate grows exactly like the reciprocal of the survival product, so it
leaves every bounded box (`not_bddAbove_value`).  Consequently:

* the **unqualified** form — no boundedness condition on the values — is
  false, and `not_noCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate` is the machine-checked
  fence saying so;
* the **bounded** form, `NoBoundedCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate`, is
  **not** refuted by anything in this file.  It is the statement the research
  route actually needs, and it is what Solan's Theorem 2.1 proves.

A reader who takes away "the no-absorbing-iterate claim is false" without the
boundedness qualifier will draw a wrong conclusion about the route.  Both
Props are stated separately below precisely so that the gap between them is
visible in the formal text and not only in prose.

## The mechanism

The refutation is not delicate.  Write `c_N = ∏_{t < N} c(y t)` for the
survival prefix.  A bounded value array forces `c_N * z_N → 0`, which is what
lets a limit argument consume the homogeneous boundary term of the backward
recursion.  Here `c_N * (z_N)_2` is the **nonzero constant** `(1 + η p)/3`
(`survivalPrefix_mul_value_two`), so the boundary term is never consumed even
though `c_N → 0`.  That unconsumed homogeneous term is the entire content of
the counterexample, and it is exactly what a boundedness hypothesis rules
out.

## The weight

With players `0, 1, 2` (the table's `1, 2, 3`) and parameter `η ≥ 0`:

| quitter set | reward |
|---|---|
| `{0}`       | `(1/3, 1, 0)` |
| `{1}`       | `(0, 1/3, 1)` |
| `{2}`       | `(1, 0, 1/3)` |
| `{0,1}`     | `((1+η)/3, 0, 1/3)` |
| `{0,2}`     | `(0, 1/3, (1+η)/3)` |
| `{1,2}`     | `(1/3, (1+η)/3, 0)` |
| `{0,1,2}`   | `(0, 0, 0)` |

`Fin 3` is used rather than an abstract three-element type because the
Fubini expansion `expect_pmfPi_fin3_bool` and the `![a, b, c]` action
notation are already available for it, which makes the eight-action
expectations reduce by `simp`.

## The witness

For `p ∈ (0,1)`, `q = 1 - p` and `K = (1 + η p)/3`, at every time `t`

    y t = (p, 0, 0),      z t = (1/3, 1, K / q ^ t).

Only `∅` and `{0}` carry mass under `y t`, so `F_{y t}(z) = (p/3 + q z_0,
p + q z_1, q z_2)`; the three fixed-point checks are `(p + q)/3 = 1/3`,
`p + q = 1`, and `q * (K / q^(t+1)) = K / q^t`.  Complementarity holds with
room to spare at the two silent coordinates: coordinate `0` is exactly
indifferent, coordinate `1` has gap `q/3 - 1 < 0`, and coordinate `2` has gap
`K (1 - q^{-t}) ≤ 0`.  The survival factor is the constant `q < 1`, so the
survival prefix is `q^N → 0`.

/-- The survival prefix always converges: every factor lies in `[0,1]`, so the

/-! ## The vanishing boundary term

The step of Solan's proof that this file's counterexample defeats is exactly
this squeeze: a bounded value sequence against a completely absorbing row
array forces the survival-prefix-weighted value to `0`.  The hypothesis used
below is an *eventual* bound on a single real sequence, which is strictly
weaker than the uniform bound over all times and all players that
`NoBoundedCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate` states: any array satisfying that
uniform bound satisfies this one, coordinate by coordinate, but not
conversely (a sequence may be unbounded yet still eventually bounded past
some horizon, or bounded only along the one coordinate examined). -/

/-- **The vanishing boundary term, general form.** If a real sequence is
eventually bounded and the rows are completely absorbing, the survival
prefix times the sequence tends to `0`.  `survivalPrefix_mul_value_two` below
is the case where even this weaker hypothesis fails: coordinate `2`'s value
is unbounded, on every tail, so no `M` works. -/

coordinate at a time. -/

/-! ## Inverse iterates and the two forms of the claim -/

variable [DecidableEq ι]

/-- An **inverse iterate** of a quitting weight: an infinite backward array of
rows `rows t` and values `values t` such that at every time the current value
is the one-stage successor of the next value under the current row, and the
current row is exactly complementary against the next value.

Unfolded, `IsεQuittingRootSuccessorCertificate reward 0 y z' z` is
`z' = F_y(z)` together with `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash reward z 0 y`, and
the latter is the pair of complementarity clauses
`(1 - y_i) * g_i ≤ 0` and `0 ≤ y_i * g_i` — i.e. `y_i < 1 → g_i ≤ 0` and
`y_i > 0 → g_i ≥ 0` — where `g_i` is `quittingRootEndpointDifference`,
player `i`'s pure-Quit value minus its pure-Continue value. -/
def IsQuittingInverseIterate
    (reward : {S : Finset ι // S.Nonempty} → Payoff ι)
    (rows : ℕ → ι → PMF Bool) (values : ℕ → Payoff ι) : Prop :=
  ∀ t, IsεQuittingRootSuccessorCertificate reward 0 (rows t)
    (values t) (values (t + 1))

/-- **The loose claim.**  "This weight admits no infinite complementary array
whose survival product tends to zero", with *no* boundedness condition on the
values.  This is the form that was restated in project control, and it is the
form refuted below. -/
def NoCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate
    (reward : {S : Finset ι // S.Nonempty} → Payoff ι) : Prop :=
  ¬ ∃ (rows : ℕ → ι → PMF Bool) (values : ℕ → Payoff ι),
      IsQuittingInverseIterate reward rows values ∧ IsCompletelyAbsorbing rows

/-- **The bounded claim.**  The same statement restricted to arrays whose
values stay in a fixed box.  Nothing in this file refutes it; it is weaker
than `NoCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate` and it is the statement the
research route needs.

**Status: neither established nor refuted here, and it is left as a bare
statement.**  `tendsto_survivalPrefix_mul_value_of_bounded` above proves
exactly the analytic step Solan's proof needs from boundedness — the
homogeneous boundary term `quittingSurvivalPrefix rows N * values N who`
vanishes — for *any* weight, not only the one below.  That step is not the
whole theorem: Solan's Theorem 2.1 goes on to use the vanished boundary term
to identify `values 0` with the equilibrium payoff of the profile induced by
`rows`, and from there derives the convex-hull bound `Σ_i y_i ≤ 4`,
`0 ≤ y_i ≤ 3` of its display (1) by a case analysis on the induced profile's
best-response structure — content with no counterpart in this file at all.
Establishing `NoBoundedCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate` for the weight
`reward` below would need that whole argument, not just the vanishing
boundary term.  Separately, the source proves its claim only "for `ε`
sufficiently small"; nothing here pins down whether
`NoBoundedCompletelyAbsorbingInverseIterate (reward η)` is even true at
every `η ≥ 0`, as opposed to some bounded range of `η`, so a further proof
attempt should not assume the unqualified-in-`η` statement is the right one
to target. -/

      (∀ t who, |values t who| ≤ M) ∧
        IsQuittingInverseIterate reward rows values ∧ IsCompletelyAbsorbing rows

/-- The loose claim is the *stronger* of the two: it implies the bounded
claim.  Hence refuting the loose claim, as the headline below does, refutes
only the stronger statement and leaves the weaker, bounded one open.  There
is no implication in the other direction, and none is proved here. -/
