# The seam price: exact residual formula, transport factor, and the deviation no-go

A `δ / ρ` "seam price" law is exact for one object, a sharp bound for a
second, and **false** for a third.  This file audits and formalizes that
law against the three contraction deficits it names:

* `ρ = 1 - ∏_{t<m} c(x_t)` -- the ordinary **value** recursion's deficit;
* `ρ⁻ᵢ = 1 - ∏_{t<m} c_{-i}(x_t)` -- coordinate `i`'s **deviation**
  recursion deficit, built from the *deleted* (opponents-only) product;
* a prefix **survival** factor, which enters every closed form
  multiplicatively and is never a denominator.

## What is proved

1. **The exact residual formula** (`orbit_eq_blockSurvival_mul_add_blockConstant`,
   `sub_blockFixedPoint_eq_div`, `sub_transportedFixedPoint_eq`, and their
   grounded forms `quitting_sub_blockFixedPoint_eq_div` /
   `quitting_sub_transportedFixedPoint_eq`).  For a coordinate `who` and *any*
   sequence obeying the raw value recursion `z t = quittingRootSuccessorPayoff
   reward (z (t+1)) (roots t)` -- no Nash exactness needed, the recursion
   alone is unconditionally affine at each coordinate
   (`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff_apply_eq_affine`) -- the block value map is
   affine with slope the *full* continue-mass product, and, when `ρ ≠ 0`,
   `z (start+fuel) who - v = d / ρ` exactly, where `d` is the boundary gap and
   `v = B / ρ` is the window's fixed point.
2. **The transport factor is multiplicative, not a denominator**
   (`one_sub_blockSurvival_eq_sum`,
   `one_sub_blockSurvival_add_eq_prefix_add_transported`,
   `quittingSurvivalPrefix_deficit_eq_prefix_add_transported`).  Splitting a
   window at a prefix of length `a` gives the *exact* decomposition
   `ρ = ρ_prefix + S(a) · ρ_block`: the local block's contribution to the
   whole window's deficit is `S(a) · ρ_block`, strictly smaller than `ρ`
   itself whenever the prefix carries any loss of its own
   (`blockSurvival_mul_deficit_lt_total_deficit_of_prefix_pos`).
3. **The seam-price law is false for the deviation objective under the full
   deficit** (`QuittingSeamPriceDeviationFalsity.seamPriceLaw_fails_for_deviation_via_fullDeficit`).
   At an isolated coordinate the deviation mismatch is the constant
   `max {0, -r_i({i})}`, independent of the absorption rate; the full deficit
   `ρ` is not.  Two explicit rates exhibit a mismatch that no single `δ / ρ`
   law can reproduce.  The correct denominator is the *deleted* deficit
   `1 - ∏ c_{-i}`, which is exactly `0` at an isolated coordinate
   (`quittingRootDeletedContinueMass_eq_one_of_isolated`), not `ρ`.
4. **No pole at zero absorption**
   (`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff_eq_of_continueMass_eq_one`,
   `quitting_orbit_eq_of_blockSurvival_eq_one`).  Full continue mass one
   forces the absorbing contribution to zero as well, so the block value map
   is the literal identity: exact closure still exists at `ρ = 0`, it simply
   cannot alter an externally prescribed mismatch.

## Verification note

The prose formula was checked against the repository's actual Bellman
definitions before formalizing.  `quittingRootSuccessorPayoff`'s coordinate
`who` reads the continuation *only* at `continuation who`
(`quittingRootExpectedPayoff_eq_absorbingContribution_add`), with slope the
*full* joint continue mass -- the same scalar at every coordinate -- which is
exactly the hypothesis the prose's `Φ(z)_i = B_i + C · z_i` needed.  The affine
formula is unconditional; passing to the quotient residual requires the explicit nonzero
full-window deficit.  At zero deficit, division does not describe a generic affine fixed point;
in the quitting specialization, full survival instead forces the identity case treated in Part 4.

/-! ## Part 5: the falsity witness for the deviation objective

At an isolated coordinate `who = true` -- opponents pure-continue, only
`who` may quit -- the deviation companion map collapses to
`w ↦ max {r_who({who}), w}` (`quittingRootCompanionMap_of_isolated`), with
deleted continue mass identically `1` regardless of the absorption rate
(`quittingRootDeletedContinueMass_eq_one_of_isolated`).  So the *correct*
denominator for deviation closure there, `1 - ∏ c_{-i}`, is exactly `0`.
Pricing the deviation mismatch by the *full* deficit `ρ` instead is false:
the true mismatch does not depend on `ρ` at all, while `ρ` itself is freely
tunable via the absorption rate. -/

halving the rate from `p = 1/2` to `p = 1/3` changes the full deficit from
`1/2` to `1/3`, yet the mismatch stays fixed at the constant `1`.  This
refutes transplanting the exact value-recursion law (deliverable 1) onto
the deviation objective with the *full* deficit in place of the *deleted*
one, which is what the deviation companion map's own slope actually is
