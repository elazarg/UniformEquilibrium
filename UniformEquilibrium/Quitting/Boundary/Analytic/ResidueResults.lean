# Stationary certificates and local-mechanism residues

This module is the public entrypoint for exact stationary certification and
the three-player reward tables that test local equilibrium mechanisms.

`QuittingStationaryEndpointCompiler`, imported through the exact-root
development, turns a stationary fixed point and finite endpoint conditions
into Nash against every behavioral deviation and then into a uniform payoff.

The switching-residue regression table has no sure exit set but admits two
distinct exact stationary uniform-equilibrium payoffs.  The parametric table
in `QuittingLocalMechanismResidueWitness` extends that example: its value at
`L = 0` is the regression table, while every `L > 18/5` also defeats the
interior two-owner/one-sure-blocker mechanism.  Those parameters retain an
exact equilibrium in the omitted double-sure-quitter cell.

Together the examples locate the obstruction in an incomplete local branch
grammar rather than in equilibrium existence.
