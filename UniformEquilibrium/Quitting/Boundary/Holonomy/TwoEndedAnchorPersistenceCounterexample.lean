# Two-ended compactness does not preserve an anchor

This is the exact finite falsifier.  The relation has two
points, all self-loops, and the one-way edge `false → true`, but no return
edge.  The finite paths spend longer and longer at each endpoint.  Their
forward windows converge to the `false` loop and their reverse windows to the
`true` loop, yet no exact loop at the forward anchor can contain the reverse
mark.
