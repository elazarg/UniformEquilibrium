# Compactness fence for realized quitting boundary holonomy

The scalar coefficient box from `QuittingBoundaryHolonomy` is not by itself
a compact space of strategically realized blocks.  This file proves the
strongest unconditional closedness statement available from the finite-chain
construction: at one fixed cutoff, the graph which retains the *entire exact
Nash--Bellman path* together with the holonomy of any nonempty subblock is
compact, hence closed.  Taking the finite union over every subblock at that
cutoff preserves compactness.  A calibrated anchored block lands in this
resolved graph with its selected minimizing path literally present, so root,
support, exact-D, and prefix provenance have not been projected away.

The final theorem is a bounded-cost fence: any compact lift which retains
the literal number of game stages as a natural-valued coordinate has
a uniform stage bound.  Consequently an arbitrary-length positive-plateau
middle cannot have such a compact lift unless one first proves a uniform
length/tightness theorem, or changes the length coordinate by adding a point
at infinity.  The latter change no longer supplies the bounded edge-cost
interface.  This is a precise compactness obstruction, not a scalar
coefficient defect.
