# Weighted boundary defects of actual finite quitting blocks

`QuittingBoundaryHolonomy.lean` bounds the five scalar coordinates of every
actual finite block in one fixed compact box
(`quittingBoundaryHolonomyCoefficientBox`): every coordinate is merely
bounded by the common reward bound `M := quittingRewardBound reward`.  That
bound is **unweighted** -- it says nothing about how close the intercept is
to zero for a block whose survival is close to one.

This file sharpens the two intercept coordinates.  The prescribed intercept
`B` and the continue-through intercept `T` are each bounded by their own
*defect*, i.e. by `M` times the shortfall of the matching survival slope from
one:

    |B| ≤ (1 - P) * M      where `P` is full product survival through the
                            block (the prescribed slope)
    |T| ≤ (1 - χ) * M      where `χ` is opponent-only survival (the
                            best-response slope)

A block whose survival is close to `1` therefore has a *small* intercept, not
merely a bounded one.  Since `1 - P ≤ 1` and `1 - χ ≤ 1` (both slopes are
nonnegative), the weighted bounds immediately imply the corresponding
unweighted conjuncts of `quittingFiniteBoundaryHolonomy_coordinates_bounded`;
see `quittingFiniteBoundaryHolonomy_intercept_tail_bounded` below, which is
the correctness check that the weighted statement is not merely plausible but
actually implies the landed box bound.  Neither field of that landed theorem
is modified or reproved here.

**Why weighted beats unweighted.** It makes each block's contribution to a
telescoped error proportional to its own absorbed mass `1 - P`
(respectively `1 - χ`), rather than to a block-count-independent constant.
Summing weighted defects over a chronological run of blocks therefore gives a
tail sum that converges as the blocks' survival approaches `1`, instead of a
bound that grows linearly in the number of blocks -- turning error estimates
into convergent tail sums rather than counts of blocks.
`abs_intercept_compose_le_add` records the two-block instance of this: the
defect of a chronological composite is at most the sum of the two blocks'
defects, so the same bound assembles along any finite composition.

## Proof strategy, and what is reused from `Math.PMFProduct`

The single-stage piece of the argument -- that the one-stage continuation
reward is bounded by `M` times the one-stage *absorbed* mass, not merely by
`M` -- is already on record as `abs_quittingFixedOpponentsContinueReward_le_hazard`
(`QuittingExceptionalBellmanTail.lean`).  Its proof isolates the single
all-continue atom from a total-probability-one sum, which is exactly the
technique behind `Math.PMFProduct.sum_coalitionMass_nonempty`; no new
coalition-level plumbing is needed to reuse it here, since every quitting
action already corresponds to exactly one coalition (there is nothing to
group: the reward-bearing atoms and the nonempty coalitions are already in
bijection one-for-one).

The multi-stage assembly (`abs_quittingFiniteContinueToBoundaryValue_zero_le_mul_defect`,
`abs_quittingFiniteTerminalHazardValue_self_zero_le_mul_defect`) is a direct
structural induction on the Bellman-style recursions, using only the
*one-step* survival recursion `S(fuel+1) = c(start) * S(start+1)(fuel)`
(already on record as `quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight_succ_front`, and as the
definitional unfold of `quittingFiniteFullSurvivalWeight`) -- not the
accumulated flat-sum telescope.  This is deliberate: the one-step recursion
already supplies everything the induction needs, so nothing about it is
re-derived.

To honor the request to reuse, rather than re-derive, the *flat-sum* form of
the telescope, `scalarSurvivalTelescope` below is a literal specialization of
the landed `Math.PMFProduct.sum_survivalMass_mul_sub_continueMass` (via the
one-coordinate index type `Unit`) to an arbitrary scalar sequence.  It is
exported as an explicit witness that the closed-form sum identity described
informally above does hold for these sequences, even though the two main
theorems reach their conclusion by the shorter direct induction instead of
routing through it.

/-! ## Bonus: composite defect bounded by the sum of block defects -/

/-- **Composite defect.** If two chronologically composed
`QuittingAffineSummary` blocks each have intercept bounded by `M` times their
own defect, and both survival slopes lie in `[0,1]`, the composite intercept
is bounded by `M` times the *sum* of the two blocks' defects.  This is the
two-block instance of what makes a tail estimate over a chronological run of
blocks possible: defects add along the composition instead of the intercept
merely staying bounded. -/
