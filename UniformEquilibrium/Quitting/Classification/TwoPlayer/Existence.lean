# Every two-player finite quitting game has a uniform equilibrium payoff

The quitting conjecture is closed on two coordinates.  Writing `owner` for one
player and `!owner` for the other, the numbers that matter are the solo values
`r_x({x})`, the cross values `r_y({x})`, and the joint values `r_y({x,y})`.
The proof is a four-way split, each branch discharged by a theorem already in
the repository except for the joint-exit branch built below.

* **Zero solo.**  If `r_x({x}) ≤ 0` at both coordinates, all-continue is an
  exact terminal equilibrium and the payoff is `0`
  (`quittingGame_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_zero_of_zeroSolo`).
* **Solo quitter.**  Otherwise fix `owner` with `r_owner({owner}) > 0`.  If
  some rate `p ∈ (0,1]` keeps the blocker from joining, the owner's solo row
  is an exact terminal equilibrium
  (`isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_soloReward_of_inactive`).
* **Pair repair.**  If no rate does, then `p = 1` fails, which gives
  `r_blocker({owner}) < r_blocker({owner,blocker})`, and the vanishing-rate
  end fails too, which forces `r_blocker({owner}) ≤ r_blocker({blocker})`.
  If additionally `r_owner({owner,blocker}) ≤ r_owner({blocker})`, the landed
  two-player pair repair applies: the blocker quits surely, the owner quits at
  a vanishing rate (`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_bool_pairRepair`).
* **Joint exit.**  In the remaining case `r_owner({blocker})` is *below*
  `r_owner({owner,blocker})`, and `p = 1`'s failure already gave
  `r_blocker({owner}) ≤ r_blocker({owner,blocker})`.  Both players quitting
  surely is then an exact terminal equilibrium.  That branch is the new
  content here: a full-rate `p = 1` instance of the sure-set/owner machinery.

## Exact rows versus equilibria at two coordinates

Every two-coordinate weight has a period-one *exact row*, by the same
`p = 1` argument used in the joint-exit branch; the case analysis is
reproduced by the split above.  But a row certificate is not an equilibrium:
the sure-set row needs no side condition, whereas a *solo* row certifies an
equilibrium of the game only when the owner's own solo value is nonnegative —
its `IsQuittingCycleAdmissible` obligation, since the owner's opponents never
absorb at a solo row.  This
exact-row trichotomy therefore does not close the two-player conjecture on its own: a
weight whose only exact singleton row belongs to a coordinate with negative
solo value, such as `r({owner}) = (1, -2)`, `r({blocker}) = (0, -1)`,
`r({owner,blocker}) = (-1, 0)`, has no exact *stationary* equilibrium at all
(hand-checked over the four corners and the interior of the rate square, not
formalized).  The pair-repair branch, whose error is linear in the owner's
vanishing rate and therefore genuinely approximate, is what covers those
weights.

/-! ## The headline -/

/-- **Every two-player finite quitting game has a uniform equilibrium
payoff.**

`HEADLINE` — the first fully closed subclass of the quitting conjecture.  The
statement is unconditional: no hypothesis on the weight, no restriction to a
class of tables, and the deviation class is all behavior strategies.

Three of the four branches name their payoff: the zero vector
(`quittingGame_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_zero_of_zeroSolo`), the owner's solo
reward `r(·)({owner})` (`quittingGame_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_soloRate`),
and the joint exit reward `r(·)({0,1})`
(`quittingGame_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_jointExit`).  The pair-repair branch
does not: its profiles are only approximate equilibria, one per accuracy, and
the payoff is extracted by compactness, so the statement below is existential
rather than an evaluation.

Three or more players are not covered.  The pair-repair branch is two-player
by construction: making a terminal set of three or more players quit surely
creates leaver deviations inside that set, which its two inequalities do not
control. -/
