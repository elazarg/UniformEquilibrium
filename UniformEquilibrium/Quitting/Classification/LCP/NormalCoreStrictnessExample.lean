# The normal core can be smaller than the first layer

This finite quitting table is a concrete diagnostic for the distinct-witness
normal-player recursion.  Its normalized singleton comparison matrix is

```text
      owner 0  1  2
row 0       0  1  1
row 1      -1  0  1
row 2       1 -1  0
```

The first screen retains players `1` and `2`: player `1` uses the already
deleted player `0` as witness, while player `2` uses player `1`.  Repeating
the screen removes `1`, then `2`, so the stabilized normal core is empty.
Thus replacing the recursive core by the one-step normal-player set changes
the index set even for a three-player singleton comparison table.
