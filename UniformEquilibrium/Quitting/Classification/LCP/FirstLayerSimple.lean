# The empty first normal-layer branch

This file proves a concrete strategic subcase of the corrected all-abnormal
regime.  Assume the first distinct-witness layer is empty.  Then every player
strictly prefers every other player's solo absorption to its own solo
absorption, after the playerwise normalization.

If every own solo reward is nonpositive, the repository's proved Never branch
applies.  Otherwise choose a player with positive own solo reward.  Strict
cross-player margins rule out the universal-joining side of the existing
solo-quitter rate dichotomy, so some positive stationary solo hazard satisfies
all inactive-player inequalities.  The landed owner-solo certification then
gives an exact terminal Nash profile, whose own terminal payoff is a
uniform-equilibrium payoff by the exact terminal-to-uniform consumer.

This is genuinely weaker than the full corrected all-abnormal lemma.  When the
first layer is nonempty but the corrected core is empty, the source proof uses
a last nonempty layer and a two-player small-hazard construction.  That
construction is not assumed here and remains the exact missing extension.
