# Standard, projective, and completely projective Q-matrices

The relevant quitting-game papers define `Q-matrix` using a normalized
simplex/projective LCP, while also comparing it with the textbook
nonhomogeneous LCP whose coefficient of `q` is fixed to one.  The conventions
are not equivalent in general.

This file defines both and proves the exact split recorded in AGKRS Remark
5.5(3):

`projective Q M ↔ standard Q M ∨ homogeneous simplex solution M`.

It also proves that Solan--Solan's "nontrivial solution of LCP(M, 0)" branch is
exactly the homogeneous simplex branch.  Thus the two Q conventions coincide
precisely after the simple stationary branch has been removed.
`IsProjectiveQBarMatrix` applies the projective notion to every nonempty
principal submatrix, exactly as in AGKRS Definition 5.2.  No strategic
conclusion is attached to any matrix predicate here.
