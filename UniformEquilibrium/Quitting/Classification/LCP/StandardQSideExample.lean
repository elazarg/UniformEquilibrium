# An exact four-player witness for the corrected-core standard-Q side

This file proves that the algebraic necessary condition for a quitting-game
counterexample is satisfiable already with four players.  The corrected core
of the displayed four-player singleton comparison table is a three-cycle.
That `3 × 3` principal matrix is textbook standard Q and has no homogeneous
simplex solution.

The standard-Q proof is constructive: for arbitrary `q`, one of the empty,
three two-coordinate, or full complementary supports supplies an explicit
LCP solution.  No numerical search or unproved matrix-classification result
is used.
