# Exact shared-punishment price for the cyclic three-player table

For the cyclic table in `QuittingSharedPunishmentThreePlayer`, every individual
punishment floor is `-1`, while every committed shared plan leaves some player
with best-reply value at least `-1/4`.  This file closes the matching upper
bound: the stationary row in which every player quits with probability `1/2`
has best-reply value exactly `-1/4` for every designated player.

Thus the shared excess is exactly `3/4`.  The value is unchanged when the
infimum is restricted to stationary product rows, so stationarity is optimal
for this table despite the positive price of sharing one punishment plan.
