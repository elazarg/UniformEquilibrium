# A sharp three-player obstruction for shared quitting punishment

This module studies the cyclic three-player weight

`r_i(S) = -1` when the next player quits and the remaining player does not,
and `r_i(S) = 0` otherwise.

The first results isolate the exact product calculation behind the obstruction:
quitting immediately against a row costs player `i` the probability
`x_next * (1 - x_other)`.  Some cyclic coordinate is always at most `1/4`.
Since every individual punishment floor is `-1`, every shared plan therefore
leaves some player at least `3/4` above its floor.
