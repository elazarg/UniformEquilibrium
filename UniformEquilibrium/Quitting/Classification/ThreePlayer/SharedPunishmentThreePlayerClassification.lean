# Classification of optimal shared punishments for the cyclic three-player table

For the cyclic table, the universal lower bound is witnessed by quitting at
time zero.  Consequently a plan whose shared excess is at most `3/4` must make
all three time-zero bad-event probabilities at least `1/4`.  Their cyclic
product structure forces every time-zero quitting marginal to equal `1/2`.
Combined with tail irrelevance, this classifies all minimizers:

* a behavior plan has shared gap `3/4` exactly when its first live row is fair;
* a stationary row has shared gap `3/4` exactly when it is the fair row.

Thus the optimizer is unique among stationary rows, while among arbitrary
history-dependent plans the entire continuation after an all-continue first
stage is free.
