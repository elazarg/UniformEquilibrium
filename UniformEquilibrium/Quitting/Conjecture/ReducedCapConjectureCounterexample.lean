# The one-player obstruction to ledger-cap producers

For a one-player quitting game, deleting the designated player's action leaves
an empty opponent set, whose survival weight is identically one.  Consequently
the reach term in either ledger-cap interface cannot tend to zero.

For the constant singleton reward `1`, a truncated package at error `ε`
would force `5 ≤ ε`; a phase-switch package would force `6 ≤ ε`.
Both interfaces therefore fail at `ε = 1`, although the underlying
one-player game plainly has an equilibrium.  The obstruction belongs to the
quantitative package, not to finite-quitting equilibrium existence.
