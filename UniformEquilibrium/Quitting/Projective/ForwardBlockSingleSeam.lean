# Reversing an exact forward Bellman block into a single-seam lasso

Let a forward orbit obey

`V_(t+1) = F(root_t, V_t)`.

A chronological quitting cycle reads a finite interval backwards.  For a
block of length `n+1` starting at `start`, phase `p : Fin (n+1)` carries

```text
root_p  = root_(start + p.rev),
value_p = V_(start + p.rev + 1).
```

Every phase except `Fin.last n` then satisfies the chronological Bellman
equation exactly.  The last phase uses `V_(start+n+1)` instead of `V_start` as
its wrapped continuation, so its policy residual is the single affine seam

```text
continueMass(root_start) * (V_start - V_(start+n+1)).
```

All hypotheses in this file are local to the displayed finite interval.  A
producer may extend its arrays arbitrarily outside the prefix; no Bellman,
support, or rationality statement is requested there.
