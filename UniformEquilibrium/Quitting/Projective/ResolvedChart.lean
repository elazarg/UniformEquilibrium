# Resolved projective chart and arc-lifting interface

`Math.AffineEqualityFarkas` starts after a finite affine tangent system

`A h = b`, `G h ≥ 0`

has been supplied. A quitting-game producer needs additional geometric data:
resolved projective points, finite chart labels, the matrices attached to each
chart, and—most importantly—a proof that every feasible lexicographic tangent
lifts to an actual positive analytic or Puiseux successor.

A linear tangent need not integrate to a real arc: the real variety
`x^2 + y^2 = 0` has the whole plane as its linearized tangent space at the
origin but no nonconstant real arc. Arc lifting must therefore be an explicit
hypothesis or a separately proved theorem; it cannot be inferred from Farkas
duality.

`QuittingResolvedProjectiveChartInterface` records the exact contract over an
arbitrary ordered field. The field `lift_feasible` is the missing
resolution/regularity theorem. Once an instance has been constructed,
`physicalSuccessor_or_farkas` composes that field with the finite affine
Farkas alternative.

This module does **not** construct an instance from the quitting Bellman
variety. An arbitrary-game producer must still prove chart coverage,
regularity or higher-jet lifting, and compatibility of the resulting physical
successor with the strategic state carried by the chart.
