# Finite charged forward packets produce projective lassos

This file is the payload-preserving capstone of finite charged closing.
Compactness first chooses one finite charge target from a fixed common compact
carrier.  The producer is then invoked once and returns a finite packet that
retains its roots, Bellman equations, support witnesses, rationality floors,
and charge proof.  The selected returned pair therefore belongs to the same
packet and can be reversed immediately into a single-seam projective lasso.

The compact carrier is fixed before the charge target is selected.  Merely
asking each target-dependent finite sequence to be bounded would be vacuous:
every finite sequence is bounded, with a bound that could grow with the target.

/-- **Finite charged-closing capstone.**

At local error `error / 2`, compactness selects one target-dependent packet
and one returned block with raw charge at least one.  Whole-block absorption
is at least one half, endpoint distance is below `error / 2`, and the reversed
block is therefore a single-seam projective lasso at error `error`. -/
