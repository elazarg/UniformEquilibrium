# The normalized singleton projective LCP

The positive-cemetery first-event limit of a vanishing-discount quitting
branch has a simple algebraic core.  After nonsingleton quitting packets have
vanished, write `z₀` for cemetery mass, `z i` for the singleton `{i}` mass,
and `value` for the limiting payoff.  The packet identities are

`z₀ + ∑ i, z i = 1`,

`value who = ∑ i, z i * reward {i} who`.

Endpoint complementarity supplies two further facts: every solo payoff is at
most the limiting value, and a singleton with positive mass pins its owner at
that solo payoff.  This file proves that these data are exactly a normalized
linear-complementarity packet.

For

`d i = reward {i} i`,

`a i = -d i`,

`M i j = reward {j} i - d i`,

`w i = value i - d i`,

we obtain

`w i = z₀ * a i + ∑ j, z j * M i j`,

`w i ≥ 0`, and `z i * w i = 0`.

This is the algebraic endpoint of the projective first-event extraction.  The
separate analytic task is to prove that a supplied discounted branch has a
limit packet satisfying the hypotheses below; no strategic realization or
chronological decoder is claimed here.
