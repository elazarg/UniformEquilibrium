# Strictness of signed cyclic correction for a fixed candidate

The signed monodromy condition is genuinely weaker than the absolute-weighted
condition for a fixed proposed cycle and displayed value.  This file records a
minimal one-player, two-phase regression:

* every stage continues with probability `1/2`;
* the displayed value differs from the true periodic value by `1,-1` around
  the two phases.

The local policy residuals are therefore `3/2,-3/2`.  For either rotation the
signed one-turn charge has magnitude `3/4`, exactly equal to one-turn
absorption, while the absolute-weighted residual is `9/4`.

This strictness is only a fixed-candidate statement.  Exact finite cycles have
zero seam and therefore package back into the signed interface, as formalized
by the all-accuracy equivalence in `QuittingSignedProjectiveLasso`.
