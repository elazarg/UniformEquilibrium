# Fixed-target semantic regression for a projective packet

The existing analytic target-mismatch example is the substantive projective
connection to the game-generic terminal semantics.  Its packet value `(1,1)`
has an explicit quantitative terminal rejection witness at error `1 / 10`.
The already proved sure-exit payoff `(1,2)` is packaged as an accepted
alternative.

This regression does not derive rejection or retargeting from generic packet,
chart, or Farkas data.  It records one concrete projective mismatch using the
terminal-layer witness types.
