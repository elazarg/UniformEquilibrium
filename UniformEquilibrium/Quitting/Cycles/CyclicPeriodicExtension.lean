# Periodic extension of an anchored chain by its cyclic continuation block

`QuittingCyclePinnedDebt` defines `quittingCyclePinnedDynamicDebt`, the exact
backward Bellman debt of an anchored chain graded against a *realized*
terminal continuation, and records that its general nonnegativity was not
proved there.  The obstruction was an interface one:
`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_nonneg` consumes `IsQuittingLivePrescribedValue`,
a `∀ time` condition, whereas `quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathValue` and
`quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathRoots` pad beyond the cutoff with `0` and
all-Continue -- a padding coherent only for the zero boundary.

This file removes the obstruction by supplying the extension that docstring
asked for.  Given an anchored chain of length `cutoff` and a cyclic
continuation block of period `period + 1`, the *periodic extension* runs the
chain on `[0, cutoff)` and then repeats the block forever.

## Index convention

`QuittingFiniteNashBellmanPath ι n = Fin (n + 1) → QuittingNashBellmanPoint ι`
and the point at index `k` carries the value *entering* stage `k` together
with the root *played at* stage `k`.  Edge `stage : Fin n` therefore relates
`path (Fin.castSucc stage)` (entering stage `stage`) to `path (Fin.succ stage)`
(entering stage `stage + 1`), and the root of stage `stage` is stored in
`path (Fin.castSucc stage)`.

The extension follows the same convention:

* `quittingCyclicPeriodicValue cutoff path period block time` is the value
  *entering* time `time`;
* `quittingCyclicPeriodicRoots cutoff path period block time` is the root
  *played at* time `time`;
* for `time < cutoff` both read `path ⟨time, _⟩`, matching
  `quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathValue` (defined for `time < cutoff + 1`) and
  `quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathRoots` (defined for `time < cutoff`);
* for `cutoff ≤ time` both read
  `block (Fin.castSucc ⟨(time - cutoff) % (period + 1), _⟩)`.

The two conventions therefore agree on exactly the windows demanded by
`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_congr`: roots on `[start, start + fuel)` and values
on `[start, start + fuel]`, which for `start + fuel = cutoff` are `[0, cutoff)`
and `[0, cutoff]`.  At `time = cutoff` the extension reads `(block 0).1`,
which equals the chain's anchor `(path (Fin.last cutoff)).1` precisely because
the block reproduces `terminal` at its origin.

## Where self-reproduction is consumed

Two gluing identities drive everything:

* `hjoin : (block 0).1 = (path (Fin.last cutoff)).1` -- the seam at the
  cutoff;
* `hcycle : (block 0).1 = (block (Fin.last (period + 1))).1` -- the seam at
  each wrap of the block.

Both follow from `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` together with anchoring,
and `hcycle` is *exactly* the block's self-reproduction clause
`(block 0).1 = terminal` combined with its terminal anchoring.  Without it the
extension breaks at every wrap: `quittingCyclicPeriodicValue_succ_of_le` would
be false.

## What absorption is and is not used for

The absorption clause of `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` is **not** used
anywhere in this file, and the lemmas below are deliberately stated without
it.  This is not a weakening of the fence.  Absorption is what makes the
realized continuation a *function of the block* rather than a free parameter
(`quittingCyclicContinuation_value_eq_of_absorbing_period_one`), and it is the
reason the cycle-pinned family is not vacuous; but the periodic extension is a
statement about the exactness grammar alone, so it does not need it, and
saying so is more informative than carrying an unused hypothesis.  The final
nonnegativity theorems are nevertheless stated against
`IsQuittingCyclicContinuation` and `quittingCyclePinnedChainSet`, which do
carry the fence.

## Second half of the file: general-period uniqueness

`QuittingCyclePinnedDebt` proves that an absorbing self-reproducing row
determines its continuation only at period one.  The second half of this file
removes that restriction: `quittingRootSequenceBackwardPayoff` composes the
block's backward steps, `quittingRootSequenceBackwardPayoff_sub` shows the
composed map is affine with linear part `∏ k, quittingStationaryContinueMass`,
and `quittingCyclicContinuation_unique_of_absorbing` concludes that two cyclic
continuation blocks playing the same rows certify the same terminal vector.
That is the statement making the realized continuation a *function of the
rows*, which is the whole reason absorption is part of the definition.  Here
absorption *is* used, through
`prod_quittingStationaryContinueMass_lt_one_of_absorbing`.

/-! ## General-period uniqueness of the realized continuation

`quittingCyclicContinuation_unique_of_absorbing_period_one` shows that a
single absorbing self-reproducing row determines its continuation.  The
statements below remove the restriction to period one: what a cyclic
continuation block certifies is a *function of its rows*, not a free
parameter, at every period.

The mechanism is the one already isolated in
`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff_sub`: a single exact backward step is affine in
the continuation with scalar linear part `quittingStationaryContinueMass`.
Composing `L` steps multiplies the linear parts, so the block map is affine
with linear part `∏ k, quittingStationaryContinueMass (roots k)`, and
absorption at a single stage makes that product `< 1`.

cyclic continuation blocks of the same period playing the same rows at every

`quittingCyclicContinuation_unique_of_absorbing_period_one`, and it is what
the absorption fence buys.  Absorption enters only through the strict
inequality `∏ k, quittingStationaryContinueMass (roots k) < 1`; at product one
the argument gives nothing, and it cannot: the all-Continue block of
`quittingAllContinueBlock_forced` has product one and its map is the identity,
