# The weighted one-stage correspondence prices no motion

Two one-stage conditions are attached to a hazard row `x` at a continuation
vector `r`, both written through the stop-minus-continue difference
`D_i = gainValue r x i (r i)` of the real-hazard encoding:

* the **weighted** condition, `IsWeightedRow`: `(1 - x i) * D i ≤ ε` and
  `-(x i) * D i ≤ ε`.  This is exactly the statement that no mixture
  deviation `β ∈ [0,1]` of coordinate `i` gains more than `ε` against the
  affine one-stage payoff `β Σ_i + (1-β) Γ_i`
  (`isWeightedRow_iff_mixPayoff_le`);
* the **support-perfect** condition, `IsSupportPerfectRow`: `x i > 0 → D i ≥
  -ε` and `x i < 1 → D i ≤ ε`.

Support-perfect implies weighted (`isWeightedRow_of_isSupportPerfectRow`);
the converse needs division by `x i` and is false at small hazards.

The separation is exhibited on the **scaled cyclic weight** -- the
Flesch--Thuijsman--Vrieze three-coordinate table divided by `3`, which is
`normalizedPerturbedWeight 0` in the encoding of
`PerturbedCyclicWeightNoExactCycle.lean` -- at the continuation vector
`r* = (4/9, 4/9, 4/9)`, the average of the three solo rows, along the
symmetric hazard row `x(t) = (t,t,t)`:

* `D_i = -(1 + 4t - 2t^2)/9` at every coordinate;
* the row is weighted-`ρ` as soon as `t ≤ 3ρ`, while it is support-perfect
  only at tolerance `≥ 1/9`;
* the motion is second order: `f(r*, x(t)) - r* = -(2t^2(3-t)/9)(1,1,1)`,
  against a quit mass `q(x(t)) = 3t - 3t^2 + t^3` that is first order.

Hence `no_motion_price_scaledCyclicWeight`: **no positive constant `ρ`
satisfies `ρ q(x) ≤ ‖f(r*,x) - r*‖` for all weighted-`ρ` rows `x` at `r*`.**

## Contents

* `oneStageMixPayoff`, `oneStageNext`: the affine one-stage payoff of a
  mixture deviation, and the one-stage successor `f_i(r,x)` it produces at
  the undeviated mixture.
* `IsWeightedRow`, `IsSupportPerfectRow`, `isWeightedRow_iff_mixPayoff_le`,
  `isWeightedRow_of_isSupportPerfectRow`.
* `scaledCyclicWeight` and its seven rows.
* `gainValue_scaledCyclicWeight_symmetricRow`,
  `oneStageNext_scaledCyclicWeight_symmetricRow`,
  `quitMass_symmetricRow`, `isWeightedRow_symmetricRow`,
  `not_isSupportPerfectRow_symmetricRow`.
* `exists_weightedRow_motion_lt`, `no_motion_price_scaledCyclicWeight`.

## What is not claimed

Nothing here says the scaled cyclic weight has no stationary and no instant
approximate equilibria; those two premises are quoted from the literature by
the source argument and are not formalized in this file.  What is proved is
the failure of the motion price *as an inequality about the weighted
correspondence*, at one explicit continuation vector of one explicit weight.
