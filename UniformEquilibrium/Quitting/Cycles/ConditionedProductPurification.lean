# Product-root purification of a conditioned quitting chronology

Conditioning a quitting tail on eventual absorption gives an exact
state-matched affine chronology, but its one-stage absorbing law is the old
product law conditioned on a nonempty quitter coalition and then assigned a
new total hazard.  This file identifies exactly when that row remains a
product root.

The single-owner branch is flexible: its conditional absorbing law is a
point mass, so its total hazard may be changed freely.  The genuinely
multi-owner branch is rigid.  Once two owners have positive quitting
probability, the conditional nonempty-coalition law determines every
Bernoulli marginal.  Hence it also determines the total absorption mass and
cannot be assigned the larger conditioned hazard unless the remaining
eventual-absorption probability was already one.

This is a strategic purification obstruction, not merely a failure of a
particular construction.  It says that a positive phantom boundary can be
removed row by row inside ordinary independent play only on singleton-support
rows.  Multi-owner rows require a chronological chattering or public
correlation argument that changes the coalition law approximately rather
than an exact one-row replacement.
