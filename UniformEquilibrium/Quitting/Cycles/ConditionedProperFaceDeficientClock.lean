# Deficient clocks on a proper singleton-tight face

A summable conditioned player-deleted clock concentrates the entire
conditioned payoff vector on that player's singleton payoff.  If the uniform
rescaled pure-Quit defect vanishes, the rescaled rows simultaneously converge
to the all-Continue root, so every player's own singleton payoff lies below
that limiting singleton vector.  The generic singleton-floor solo compiler
then produces a uniform-equilibrium payoff.

This removes deleted-clock completeness as an independent obstruction even
when some phantom-boundary coordinates are strict.  The only remaining
obstruction is the same nonvanishing immediate-Quit defect that appears in
the deleted-complete proper-face compiler.
