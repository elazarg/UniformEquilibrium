# An admissible absorbing cycle carries a terminal approximate equilibrium

`QuittingCyclePinnedDebt` isolates the carrier of the absorbing-cycle program:
an `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`, i.e. a finite exact Nash--Bellman block
which reproduces its own value at its origin and absorbs at some stage.
This file closes the remaining arrow of the conditional: *an admissible
absorbing block generates a behavior profile which is a terminal approximate
equilibrium at every accuracy*, in exactly the sense the landed
terminal-to-uniform consumer
`quittingGame_exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_terminalNash_all_errors`
requires, namely
`(quittingGame reward).IsεAsymptoticNash (quittingTerminalPayoff reward) ε`.
That predicate quantifies over **all** behavioral deviations of the deviating
player, so nothing below is restricted to stopping-time deviations.

The infinite object is supplied at the *profile* level rather than at the
prescribed-value level: `quittingCyclicRootSequence` reads the block's rows
forever and `quittingCyclicBehaviorProfile` turns them into a behavior profile,
whose `quittingTerminalPayoff` is by definition `quittingCyclicTerminalValue`.
`QuittingCyclicPeriodicExtension`'s value-level extension is the same
construction read on prescribed values, and is not needed here.

## The two hypotheses

**(H1) absorbing cyclic continuation block.**  `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock
reward terminal (period + 1) block`.  This is the carrier itself.

**(H2) zero deviation mismatch at every coordinate.**  This is supplied as an
explicit hypothesis and is *not* derived from (H1).  It is stated as
`IsQuittingCycleAdmissible`: for every coordinate `who`, either the deleted
(opponent) survival product around the cycle is strictly below one, or the solo
reward `r_who({who})` is nonnegative.

That disjunction is exactly the repository's own deviation-machinery branch
condition -- it is the `hbranch` argument of the umbrella local-to-global bound
`quittingRootSequenceHazardTerminalGap_le_tsum_residual_of_zero_or_nonnegativeSolo`
-- and it is exactly the characterization of vanishing deviation mismatch
recorded in the program notes: the deleted survival product `P_who` of an
absorbing cycle is `1` only in the *isolated* configuration where every opponent
of `who` is silent at every phase, and there the mismatch is `[-r_who({who})]₊`,
so it vanishes precisely when `r_who({who}) ≥ 0`.

**(H2) is not redundant** -- *hand check, not formalized here.*  Take two
players, let player `1` quit with probability `1/2` at the single block stage
and player `2` never quit, and set `r_1({1}) = -1`, `r_1({2}) = r_1({1,2})` and
player `2`'s entries all `0`.  Every clause of
`IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` holds: the endpoint difference vanishes at
player `1` (both his pure Quit and pure Continue pay `-1`) and player `2`'s
pure Quit pays `0`, which is his displayed value; the absorption mass is `1/2`.
The block's value at coordinate `1` is `-1`.  But player `1` can continue
forever, in which case nobody ever absorbs and he collects `0`, a gain of `1`.
Here `P_1 = 1` and `r_1({1}) < 0`, so (H2) fails at coordinate `1`, and the
periodic profile is *not* terminal `ε`-Nash for `ε < 1`.  So no theorem of this
shape can drop (H2), and (H2) is not derivable from (H1).

## What absorption alone does buy

The block's displayed value is pinned to the *realized* terminal payoff of the
generated profile by absorption alone: `quittingRootSuccessorPayoff` is affine
in the continuation with scalar linear part the joint all-continue mass, and one
absorbing stage makes the product of those masses around the cycle strictly less
than one.  This is
`eq_quittingCyclicTerminalValue_of_rootSuccessorPayoff_of_absorbing`, a strict
strengthening of the existing
`eq_quittingCyclicTerminalValue_of_rootSuccessorPayoff`, whose hypothesis is the
*playerwise* contraction (the deleted masses dominate the joint mass, so the
playerwise hypothesis is the stronger one).

## Relation to the existing periodic compiler

`isZeroAsymptoticNash_quittingCyclicBehaviorProfile_of_certificate_finite`
already compiles a cyclic certificate to a terminal Nash profile, but under
playerwise contraction at *every* coordinate.  That hypothesis fails on the
program's own running example (the stationary row of the surgery table, where
the row's quitter has a silent opponent).  The results below replace it by
(H1) + (H2), which that example does satisfy.

and it is the characterization of vanishing deviation mismatch on an absorbing
cycle: the deleted product equals one only when every opponent of `who` is
silent at every phase, and in that isolated configuration the mismatch is
`max {0, r_who({who})} - r_who({who}) = [-r_who({who})]₊`. -/

absorbing cyclic continuation block whose deviation mismatch vanishes at every
coordinate, then the periodic profile generated by the block is exactly
terminal Nash against every behavioral deviation.

Hypothesis honesty: `hadmissible` is an explicit hypothesis; nothing below
derives it from `hblock`, and it cannot be derived (see the module docstring for
a two-player absorbing exact block violating it). -/

/-! ## A worked instance: the surgery table's stationary block

The stationary row of the surgery table is an absorbing cyclic continuation
block (`stationaryBlock_isQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`).  It is admissible,
but it does **not** satisfy the playerwise contraction hypothesis of the
existing periodic compiler: player one's only opponent never quits, so the
deleted survival product at player one is exactly `1`.  Admissibility survives
there only through the second branch, `0 ≤ r_1({1}) = a`.  So the theorems above
are a genuine generalization on this program's own running example, and not a
restatement. -/
