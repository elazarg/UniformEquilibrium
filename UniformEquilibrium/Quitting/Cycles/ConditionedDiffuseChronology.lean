# The diffuse conditioned quitting chronology

Conditioning a positive-survival quitting tail on eventual absorption keeps
the exact order of its states but generally destroys the product form of a
row.  In the diffuse branch the conditioned one-stage absorption weights tend
to zero.  This file records what that hypothesis gives without a strategic
purification assumption.

* physical absorption is bounded by conditioned absorption;
* conditional collision is quadratic in the conditioned mesh;
* the conditioned continuation clock telescopes exactly and is complete when
  the remaining eventual-absorption mass vanishes on late tails;
* active-face errors therefore vanish along every diffuse active subsequence;
* conditioning preserves a payoff floor exactly on tight boundary
  coordinates, while on a strict boundary coordinate it has an explicit
  additional viability inequality.

The last distinction is load-bearing.  Diffuse collision removal and active
pinning do not by themselves produce an essential-APS path: a strict boundary
slack can subsidize a conditionally nonviable coordinate.
