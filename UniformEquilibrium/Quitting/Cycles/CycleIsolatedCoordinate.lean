# The isolated coordinate: the `P_who = 1` branch of the cycle mismatch

`QuittingCycleMismatchContraction.lean` treats the branch where the deleted
survival product

`P_who = quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight roots who 0 period`

of an absorbing cyclic continuation block is strictly below one: there the
cyclic companion composite contracts and the anchored mismatch vanishes, with
no sign hypothesis.  This file treats the complementary branch `P_who = 1` and
combines the two into the full characterization.

## The four steps

1. **`P_who = 1` forces isolation.**  Each phase factor
   `c_{-who}(y_k) = quittingRootDeletedContinueMass (roots k) who` lies in
   `[0,1]`, so the product is `1` iff every factor is `1`, iff every opponent
   `j ≠ who` continues surely at every phase
   (`quittingRootDeletedContinueMass_eq_one_iff_isQuittingIsolatedRoot`,
   `isQuittingIsolatedWindow_iff_opponentSurvivalWeight_eq_one`).  An isolated
   root *is* the solo-quitter row of `QuittingSoloQuitterEquilibrium.lean`
   carrying `who`'s own marginal
   (`isQuittingIsolatedRoot_iff_exists_soloStationaryRoot`), which is where all
   of its endpoint formulas come from.
2. **In the isolated configuration the cyclic value is the solo weight.**  With
   all opponents silent the one-stage backward value map at `who` collapses to
   the scalar convex combination `z_k = y_k · r_who({who}) + (1 - y_k) · z_{k+1}`
   (`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff_of_isolated`), so the deviation of the phase
   value from `r_who({who})` is transported around the cycle by the product of
   the *joint* all-continue masses.  One absorbing stage makes that product
   strictly below one -- with all opponents silent only `who` can supply
   absorbing mass -- and the block's origin and cutoff values agree, so the
   deviation is zero:
   `quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_value_eq_soloReward_of_isolated`.
3. **The mismatch.**  The isolated companion map is `w ↦ max {r_who({who}), w}`
   (`quittingRootCompanionMap_of_isolated`), so the anchored orbit from
   `Λ_who = max {0, r_who({who})}` is *constant* at `Λ_who`, and the mismatch is
   exactly `Λ_who - r_who({who}) = max {0, -r_who({who})}`
   (`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_eq_of_isolated`).
4. **At most one coordinate is isolated.**  Two isolated coordinates would leave
   every coordinate silent at the absorbing stage
   (`eq_of_isQuittingIsolatedRoot_of_absorbing`, and its block form
   `eq_of_isQuittingIsolatedWindow_of_cyclicBlock`).  This step is independent
   of steps 1--3.

## What is proved and what is not

The combined characterization
`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_characterization` covers the anchored
companion mismatch of an absorbing cyclic continuation block at a single
coordinate, at arbitrary period, with no sign hypothesis.  It says nothing
about the deviation gain of the infinitely repeated block beyond the scalar
companion recursion, and nothing about blocks that fail to absorb.

/-! ## The combined characterization -/

/-- **The full cycle mismatch characterization.**

For an absorbing cyclic continuation block of any period and any coordinate
`who`, the anchored companion mismatch is zero *unless* `who` is isolated --
every opponent silent at every phase, equivalently the deleted survival product
`P_who` equal to one -- and `r_who({who}) < 0`; in that exceptional case the
block's own value at `who` is `r_who({who})` and the mismatch is exactly
`-r_who({who})`.

`HEADLINE` — the complete mismatch characterization for absorbing cyclic
continuation blocks, combining the contraction branch
`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_eq_zero` (`P_who < 1`) with the
isolated branch (`P_who = 1`) proved here.  It characterizes only the *scalar
companion* mismatch measured from the solo-quit anchor; it makes no claim about
the deviation gain of the infinitely repeated block, and it says nothing about
blocks that fail to absorb.  No sign hypothesis is used in either branch. -/

/-! ## Regression: the exceptional branch is inhabited

Both disjuncts of the characterization are reachable.  The contracting one is
witnessed by `QuittingCycleMismatchAudit` in the companion module, at the
non-owner coordinate `false` where `P_false = 1/2 < 1`.

The exceptional one is witnessed below.  Two coordinates indexed by `Bool`; the
owner `true` quits at rate `1/2` and the coordinate `false` continues surely, so
`true` is isolated.  Every reward entry is `0` except `r_true({true}) = -1`.  The
row is an absorbing exact complementary cycle by
`quittingRowBlock_isQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`, its value at `true` is
`-1`, the anchored orbit is constant at `Λ_true = max {0, -1} = 0`, and the
mismatch is `1`.

This is the scalar-companion half of the *hand check* recorded in the module
docstring of `QuittingAdmissibleCycleTerminalEquilibrium.lean` (that its
hypothesis (H2) is not redundant).  It is not the game-level statement: nothing
here claims that the periodic profile fails to be terminal `ε`-Nash. -/
