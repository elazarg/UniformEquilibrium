# Conditioning a positive-survival quitting tail on eventual absorption

A bounded exact quitting tail with positive probability of never absorbing
may carry a nonzero phantom boundary.  Conditioning the tail on eventual
absorption removes that boundary without losing chronology.

The remaining eventual-absorption probability is the correct projective
scale.  Unlike the ratio of two consecutive one-stage absorption masses, its
successive ratio is automatically in the unit interval.  The conditioned
value satisfies an exact affine recurrence between consecutive conditioned
states: its absorbing coefficient is the current one-stage absorption divided
by remaining eventual absorption, and its continuation coefficient is the
complementary surviving share.

This is an accounting theorem, not a strategic compiler.  Conditioning need
not preserve the punishment floor.  The last estimate records the precise
support gate: an active owner's conditioned state is close to its singleton
payoff when its opponent-absorption mass is small relative to the remaining
eventual-absorption scale.
