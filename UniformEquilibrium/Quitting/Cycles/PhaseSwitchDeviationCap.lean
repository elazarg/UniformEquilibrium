# The one-sided deviation cap of a phase-switched quitting profile

This file assembles the folk-theorem inequality for the phase-switch
combinator of `QuittingPhaseSwitchProfile.lean`.  Fix a plan, a punishment
plan and a switch stage `T`, and suppose

* **(a)** the *truncated* plan -- the plan frozen to all-Continue from `T` on
  -- caps player `who`'s unilateral gain by `planError`;
* **(b)** the punishment plan caps every unilateral continuation payoff of
  `who` by `punishCap + punishError`;
* **(c)** the plan phase reaches `T` with opponent-survival mass at most
  `survivalCap`.

Then the switched profile caps `who`'s unilateral gain by
`planError + survivalCap * (max (punishCap + punishError) 0 + bound)`.

Hypothesis (b) is *hypothesised*, not proved: whether a punishment plan
attains a player's punishment level is the separate lower-bound question.
The value of the assembly is exactly that it turns any future punishment
bound into an existence engine for terminal -- hence uniform -- approximate
equilibria, via `quittingGame_isUniformεEquilibrium_of_terminalNash_finite`.

## Where the live-hazard collapse is load-bearing

The deviator is an **arbitrary behaviour strategy**, not a time-indexed
plan.  It is reduced to a time-indexed hazard exactly once, by
`quittingTerminalPayoff_update_eq_rootSequenceHazardTerminalValue`
(`QuittingBehaviorPureTimeExtremality.lean`), which evaluates the deviation
along the quitting game's unique live public history.  Everything after that
reduction -- the plan-phase/punishment-phase split, the survival bookkeeping,
and the arithmetic -- is a statement about hazard sequences.  The converse
direction, `quittingRootSequenceHazardTerminalValue_eq_terminalPayoff_update`,
lets hypotheses (a) and (b) be discharged against behaviour strategies even
though they are stated for hazards.

## Main results

* `quittingRootSequenceHazardTerminalValue_quittingPhaseSwitchRoots_le` --
  the cap, for an arbitrary hazard deviation
* `quittingTerminalPayoff_update_quittingPhaseSwitchProfile_le` -- the cap,
  for an arbitrary behaviour deviation
* `isεAsymptoticNash_quittingPhaseSwitchProfile` -- the terminal
  approximate-Nash consumer statement
* `isUniformεEquilibrium_quittingPhaseSwitchProfile` -- the uniform
  approximate-equilibrium consumer statement

of the live-hazard collapse: it lets a hypothesis stated for hazards be
discharged by a statement about behaviour strategies, and conversely. -/

/-! ## The consumer statements -/

/-- **The terminal approximate-Nash consumer statement.**  With the plan
cap, the punishment cap and the survival cap in force for *every* player,
the phase-switched profile is a terminal `ε`-Nash equilibrium for any `ε`
dominating the assembled per-player caps.

The punishment cap `punishCap` is allowed to vary with the player, as it
must: it is that player's hypothesised punishment level. -/

/-- **The uniform approximate-equilibrium consumer statement.**  Feeding the
terminal cap into the tree's terminal-to-uniform selection makes the

stationary nor cyclic: any punishment bound, once supplied, yields uniform
`ε'`-equilibria. -/

/-! ## Choosing the switch stage -/

/-- **The switch clock.**  If every player's opponent-survival curve along
the plan vanishes, then for every positive survival cap some fixed stage
meets hypothesis (c) simultaneously for all players.

This is the absorption clock the cap consumes.  It is *not*
`quittingPlannedSurvivalStoppingIndex`: that index is the first crossing of
a single player's own *prescribed* survival curve, which the deviator
controls and can therefore refuse to follow.  Hypothesis (c) has to be
carried by the opponents' curve, which a unilateral deviation cannot move
(`quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight_quittingRootSequenceUpdate`). -/
