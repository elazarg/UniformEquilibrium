# Compiler for the tight diffuse conditioned branch

This module closes the finite-law seam in diffuse product rescaling.  The
basic estimate partitions a finite law into its empty atom, singleton atoms,
and collision atoms.  If the source singleton masses dominate the target
singleton masses, their total-variation distance is paid entirely by the
empty mismatch and the target collision mass.  Applied to hazards `a * x`
conditioned at scale `a` and the product hazards `x`, this gives the sharp
quadratic law error.

The final statements use the joint clock for the resulting policy error and
the deleted clock for Continue deviations.  Boundary tightness is explicit;
no assertion is made on a strict phantom-boundary coordinate.

/-- **Proper-face diffuse compiler.**  A late source row may contain both
singleton-tight active players and literal-Never spectators.  Tight players
use the deleted-clock strategic estimate.  Spectators remain pure Continue
after rescaling, so their Continue endpoint is controlled by the joint
policy estimate; only their pure-Quit endpoint must be supplied separately.

This is the exact compiler interface for the proper singleton-tight face:
strict plateau coordinates cost no Continue error and expose only an
immediate-Quit obstruction. -/
