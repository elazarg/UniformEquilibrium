# The repaired disjunction: a third branch for the isolated negative coordinate

`QuittingDisjunctionCounterexample.lean` refutes the two-branch carrier

    `IsQuittingZeroSolo reward ∨ HasAdmissibleAbsorbingQuittingCycle reward`

with the weight `r({1}) = r({2}) = (1, -1)`, `r({1,2}) = (0, 1)`.  That weight
fails both branches through one nameable configuration and no other: its
absorbing cycles all isolate coordinate `2`, whose solo weight `r_2({2}) = -1`
is negative.  This file names that configuration as a third branch and proves
the repaired disjunction over the weights the argument can see.

## The third branch

`HasIsolatedNegativeAbsorbingQuittingCycle reward` says: some absorbing cyclic
continuation block (the same `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` notion as in
`QuittingCyclePinnedDebt.lean`) has a coordinate `who` that is *isolated* --
every opponent silent at every phase, `IsQuittingIsolatedWindow` of
`QuittingCycleIsolatedCoordinate.lean` -- with `r_who({who}) < 0`.

That file already pins down everything about this configuration:

* the anchored companion mismatch there is **exactly** `-r_who({who})`
  (`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_eq_of_isolated`, restated as
  `quittingIsolatedNegativeCycle_mismatch_eq` below), and the block's own value
  at `who` is `r_who({who})` itself; and
* an absorbing block isolates **at most one** coordinate
  (`eq_of_isQuittingIsolatedWindow_of_cyclicBlock`), so the branch speaks of a
  unique coordinate and the mismatch value is unambiguous.

## Exhaustiveness, and its scope

`quittingCycle_zeroSolo_or_admissible_or_isolatedNegative` proves: **for every
weight admitting some absorbing cyclic continuation block**, one of the three
branches holds.  The engine is the block-level dichotomy
`isQuittingCycleAdmissible_or_isolated_negative`: at a fixed block, either every
coordinate satisfies `IsQuittingCycleZeroDeviationMismatchAt` -- which *is*
admissibility -- or some coordinate fails both of its disjuncts, so its cyclic
deleted product is `1` and its solo weight is negative.  A deleted product equal
to one is exactly isolation
(`isQuittingIsolatedRoot_of_deletedContinueMass_eq_one`, step 1 of
`QuittingCycleIsolatedCoordinate.lean`, packaged here as
`prod_fixedOpponentsContinueMass_eq_one_iff_isQuittingIsolatedWindow`), so the
failure is the isolated-negative configuration and nothing else.  That this is
the only way the *mismatch itself* can be nonzero is the separate landed
characterization `quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_characterization`;
the exhaustiveness proof here does not consume it, it consumes the same step-1
equivalence the characterization is built on.

The hypothesis is not decoration.  Weights admitting **no** absorbing
complementary cycle of any period are not covered by any of the three branches
as stated, and that residue is genuinely open here: this repository does not
prove that every weight admits an absorbing complementary cycle.  The usual
argument -- take discounted complementary rows and let the discount tend to one,
then some limit absorbs -- rests on an external attribution that has **not** been
audited in this repository.  So the trichotomy below is conditional, and must
not be quoted as an unconditional statement about all weights.

## What the repair does not buy

Sufficiency is known for only two of the three branches.  Zero-solo delivers a
uniform equilibrium payoff (`quittingGame_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_zero_of_zeroSolo`)
and so does an admissible absorbing cycle
(`exists_uniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_admissible_quittingCyclicContinuationBlock`).
The isolated-negative branch has **no** sufficiency theorem: a weight landing
there is not thereby known to have a uniform equilibrium payoff.  Repairing the
carrier's exhaustiveness therefore does not close the finite-quitting
conjecture, and nothing here should be read as doing so.

## Mutual exclusivity

The three branches are *exhaustive but not exclusive*
(`quittingThreeBranch_not_mutually_exclusive`): zero-solo overlaps both of the
other two, witnessed by machine-checked examples.  What *is* exclusive is the
pairing at a fixed block: an admissible cycle has no isolated negative
coordinate (`not_isQuittingCycleAdmissible_of_isolated_negative`), which is the
exact content of admissibility.  The weight-level branches quantify over
different blocks, so they can and do overlap.

/-! ## The third branch -/

/-- A weight **admits an isolated negative absorbing cycle** when some absorbing
cyclic continuation block has a coordinate that is isolated at every phase --
every opponent silent -- and whose solo-quit weight `r_who({who})` is strictly
negative.

This is the configuration that the refuted two-branch disjunction missed: by
`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_characterization` it is the *only*
way for the anchored companion mismatch of an absorbing block to be nonzero. -/

the solo weight is negative, and a non-contracting product is one, which is
isolation.

Every weight admitting *some* absorbing cyclic continuation block is zero-solo,
or admits an admissible absorbing cycle, or admits an absorbing cycle isolating
a coordinate of negative solo weight.

`HEADLINE` — the repair of the carrier refuted by
`not_forall_isQuittingZeroSolo_or_hasAdmissibleAbsorbingQuittingCycle`: adding
the isolated-negative branch makes the disjunction exhaustive on every weight
that admits an absorbing cycle at all, since the only way admissibility can fail
at a block is the isolated-negative configuration, whose mismatch is then
exactly `-r_who({who})` by `quittingIsolatedNegativeCycle_mismatch_eq`.  It does
**not** give an existence theorem: sufficiency is known for the zero-solo and
admissible branches only, the isolated-negative branch has no sufficiency
theorem, and weights admitting no absorbing complementary cycle of any period
are outside the hypothesis and remain open. -/
