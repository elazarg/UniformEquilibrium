# The signed phasewise accumulation is the companion-map gain of a relaxed cycle

Fix a coordinate `who` and a periodic root sequence `roots : ℕ → ι → PMF Bool` together
with a *prescribed* scalar payoff sequence `prescribed : ℕ → ℝ` that is self-consistent
(`IsQuittingLivePrescribedValue`) but is **not** assumed to be any kind of Nash
equilibrium.  `QuittingCycleMismatchContraction.lean` already treats the case where
`prescribed` is *exactly* endpoint-Nash against itself: there the companion map's own
cyclic fixed point coincides with `prescribed`, so the anchored mismatch is zero
(`quittingCyclicContinuationBlock_mismatch_eq_zero`).  This file drops that hypothesis
entirely and computes the *gap* between the companion map's cyclic fixed point and
`prescribed` in closed form.

This file formalizes the claim that the signed phasewise
accumulation of the local gaps ... equals the gain exactly.  The **local gap** at phase
`k` is `quittingRootEndpointDifference reward (fun _ => prescribed (k + 1)) (roots k) who`
(`g_k` below), and the **gain** is identified here with the amount
by which the companion map's own cyclic fixed point exceeds `prescribed 0` -- this is
exactly what "gain of a relaxed cycle" means once the companion-map machinery already
proved in `QuittingCycleMismatchContraction.lean` is applied without the exact-Nash
hypothesis.

## Re-derivation, and where it strengthens the reported claim

The claim above states the identity under a *relaxed complementarity* hypothesis
(`IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash` at some defect `ε`, matched exactly against the source's
own equations (5)-(6) once the two one-sided defect inequalities are read jointly).  The
re-derivation carried out to build this file establishes the identity **without any
complementarity hypothesis at all**: it is a statement purely about the companion-map
recursion versus the value recursion `quittingRootSuccessorPayoff`, and complementarity
is only what a *separate* argument would need to bound the local gaps by `ε` (the
`ε C₁` envelope of the reported claim, reusing `Math/CyclicMaxAffineBound.lean`, not
reproved here).  So the identity below is strictly more general than what was asked for.

The re-derivation also rechecked the reported closed form's outer `max {0, ...}` term
(reported equations (13), (18), (38)).  That "0" branch is *not* part of the abstract
max-affine recursion's solution -- solving the bare two-branch recursion
`d_k = max {α_k, β_k + q_k d_{k+1}}` around the cycle gives `max {stopGap, contGap}`
with **no** outer `0`.  The reported text calls the "0" "redundant... once one uses K2"
without pinning down why.  The reason is elementary and does not need the pure-time
reduction K2 at all: since `p_k := (roots k who true).toReal` and
`q_k := quittingRootDeletedContinueMass (roots k) who` both lie in `[0, 1]`, the two
local weights `α_k = (1 - p_k) * g_k` and `β_k = -p_k * g_k` always have `α_k * β_k ≤ 0`
(a probability weight and its complement cannot both make the same-signed local gap
strictly worse), so `max {α_k, β_k} ≥ 0` at every phase; chaining this around a cycle
with survival product `< 1` forces the whole cyclic solution to be `≥ 0`.  So the outer
`0` is true but genuinely redundant, for a reason internal to the recursion, not an
appeal to feasibility of "not deviating."  This fact is not needed for the identity
below (which only needs the base-point value, not its sign), so it is not formalized
here, but it is recorded as a checked correction to the reported proof sketch.

## What is proved

* `quittingSignedStopWeight`, `quittingSignedContinueWeight` -- the two signed local
  weights `α_k = (1 - p_k) g_k` and `β_k = -p_k g_k` of the reported equations (9)-(10).
* `quittingSignedStopGap`, `quittingSignedContinueGap` -- the finite unrolled stop and
  continuation excess over a window of `m + 1` phases (reported equations (11)-(19)).
* `quittingRelaxedCycleGain` -- the **signed phasewise accumulation**
  `max {stopGap, contGap / (1 - P)}`, the reported `Q_{i,1}` (equations (23)-(26)).
* `quittingCompanionComposite_sub_prescribed_eq` -- the exact finite identity
  expressing `quittingCompanionComposite` applied at any continuation, minus
  `prescribed`, as this signed max-affine expression.  Purely algebraic; consumes only
  the value recursion `IsQuittingLivePrescribedValue`, no complementarity.
* `quittingCompanionComposite_prescribed_add_gain_eq` -- **the main identity**: adding
  `quittingRelaxedCycleGain` to `prescribed 0` gives a fixed point of the one-period
  companion composite.
* `quittingRelaxedCycleGain_unique` -- that fixed point, and hence the gain, is unique.
* `quittingRelaxedCycleGain_eq_zero_iff` -- **necessary and sufficient**: the signed
  accumulation vanishes iff the companion composite's cyclic fixed point already equals
  `prescribed 0`, i.e. iff there is no deviation incentive to correct.

## The behavioral supremum

Identifying `quittingRelaxedCycleGain` with the literal supremum over *all* behavioral
deviations (`quittingTerminalPayoff` over `Function.update profile who deviation`) needs
two further ingredients: (1) the pure-time reduction of that supremum to pure quit-time
deviations (`sSup_range_quittingTerminalPayoff_update_eq_pureTime` in
`QuittingBehaviorPureTimeExtremality.lean`), and (2) the fact that the supremum over pure
quit-time deviations of a periodic live root sequence equals the companion composite's
cyclic fixed point constructed here -- a "value of an infinite-horizon optimal-stopping
problem equals its Bellman fixed point" argument.  Both are proved in
`QuittingPeriodicPureTimeBellman.lean`
(`sSup_range_quittingRootSequencePureTimeTerminalValue_eq_of_fixed` supplies (2)); its
closing theorem `sSup_range_quittingTerminalPayoff_update_eq_prescribed_add_gain` composes
them with `quittingCompanionComposite_prescribed_add_gain_eq` below to identify the
supremum over all unilateral behavioral deviations, for a profile whose live root sequence
is periodic, with `prescribed 0 + quittingRelaxedCycleGain`.  Consequently "gain" in this
file already means exactly the literal supremum over behavioral deviations under that
periodicity hypothesis, matching what `QuittingCycleMismatchContraction.lean`'s existing
"mismatch" means in the exact-Nash case (there `prescribed` itself is the fixed point, so
the gap is `0`); this file's identity is the strict generalization of that gap to the
case where `prescribed` need not be any kind of Nash value.
