# Stationary quitting gains and complementarity

This file isolates the scalar algebra behind stationary quitting profiles
before specializing it to the game-facing quantities.  The exceptional
zero- and singleton-support boundaries are kept separate from the later
contracting equivalences.

/-- The two exact stationary gap factorizations.  Here `x` is the player's
quit probability, `c` is the opponents' continue mass, `Q` is the pure-Quit
value, `A` is the unconditional absorbing contribution under pure Continue,
`h` is total absorption mass, `W` is the prescribed stationary payoff, and
`G = (1-c)Q-A` is the stationary gain.

No division, positivity, or contraction hypothesis is needed for these
identities. -/
