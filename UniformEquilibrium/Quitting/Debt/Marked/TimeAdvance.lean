# Advancing a same-date marked transfer

A marked first-opponent selection may transfer the player flag without
advancing calendar time.  This file isolates the elementary Bellman estimate
which controls that obstruction.

For a one-stage Nash--Bellman edge `current → successor` with absorption
mass `p`, bounded terminal rewards and bounded successor values give

`|current i - successor i| ≤ 2 M p`.

Consequently, if a newly marked player has current value at most `-θ`, then
either the root has the quantitatively positive jump `p ≥ θ/(4M)`, or the
same player remains at most `-θ/2` at the survived successor.  In the latter
case the flag can be moved forward by one actual stage.

The positive-jump alternative is an actual compatible Bellman edge, but this
file does not claim that its successor is again negatively marked or that one
such edge is already a terminal discharge.  Those are separate SCC/path
questions.
