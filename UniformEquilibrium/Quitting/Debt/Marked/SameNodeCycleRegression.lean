# A same-node marked-transfer cycle need not give an invariant edge law

This file records a two-player, two-edge exact quitting-game calculation.  At
the first root both players mix one half, its current value is `(-2,-2)`, and
its declared successor is `(-1,-1)`.  At the second root both players quit
surely, with successor zero.  Both roots are exact Nash roots and both
successor equations hold.

At the first root either player can mark the other player using a bad
owner-deleted singleton atom.  Consequently a procedure which merely changes
the marked player, but does not advance the suffix time, can alternate the two
marks forever while selecting the *same* Bellman edge.  Repeated marks then do
not imply matching current and successor marginals: the selected edge still
has distinct endpoints `(-2,-2)` and `(-1,-1)`.

This is only a regression for that recurrence inference.  It is not a
counterexample to equilibrium existence: the displayed two-edge chain itself
ends at a surely absorbing exact Nash root.
