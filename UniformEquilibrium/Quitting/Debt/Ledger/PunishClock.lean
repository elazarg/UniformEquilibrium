# The cumulative-advantage ledger and the punish clock

Simon (Adv. Appl. Math. 38 (2007) 1-26) opens the proof of Proposition 3 by
attaching to every player `n` a **ledger**

`W_i^n := ∑_{k<i} (b_n(r_{k+1}(p), p_k) − r_k^n(p))`,

"the cumulative advantage `n` has obtained by choosing `c` at all stages
before `i`, conditioned on no other player having quit", and two clocks:
`i^n_∗`, the first `i` with `W_i^n ≥ ε`, and `i^n_♯`, the first `i` at which
the player's own *prescribed* survival `c_i^n = ∏_{k<i}(1 − p_k^n)` has
fallen to `ε/M`.  The switch stage is `î := min_n min(i^n_∗, i^n_♯)` and the
punished player `n̂` is a minimiser, preferring an `i^n_♯`-achiever.

This file formalises that layer for the mixture encoding over root sequences.

## Which quantity the summand is

Simon's `b_n(r_{k+1}(p), p_k)` is the **deleted** object: player `n`'s payoff
from playing pure Continue at stage `k` against the *other* players' stage-`k`
marginals, resumed by the plan's own continuation vector.  In this repository
that is `quittingRootContinuePayoff` at the root `roots k` with tail
`quittingRootSequenceTailVector reward roots (k + 1)`, and `r_k^n(p)` is
`quittingRootSequenceTerminalValue reward roots who k`.  So

`quittingLedgerStageAdvantage = quittingRootContinuePayoff − terminalValue`,

and the deleted normalisation is visible in
`quittingLedgerStageAdvantage_eq_fixedOpponents`: the summand is
`R_k + c_k · V_{k+1} − V_k` with `c_k` the *opponent-only* continue mass
`quittingFixedOpponentsContinueMass`, never the joint mass.  The two are
related by the survival-prefix bridge, recorded here in ledger form as
`quittingLedgerJointContinueMass_eq_own_mul_deleted`: the joint mass is the
deleted mass times `who`'s own continue probability.  Both terms of the
summand are *conditional on reaching stage `k` live*; the ledger is a plain
unweighted sum of conditional advantages, and the survival weights appear
only when it is cashed against a global deviation (part 3 below).

The exact identity landed on is

`quittingLedgerStageAdvantage_eq_neg_quitProbability_mul_endpointDifference`:

`W_{k+1} − W_k = −(p_k^n · quittingRootEndpointDifference …)`,

`p_k^n` being `who`'s own prescribed quit probability at stage `k`.  It is
*not* the negation of `quittingStageGap`: that gap measures Quit against the
Continue value, whereas the ledger measures Continue against the plan's own
mixture.  The exact difference between the two readings is recorded in
`quittingLedgerStageAdvantage_add_quittingStageGap`.  What the increment *is*
is the "pure Continue regret" half of `IsεQuittingRootEndpointNash`, which is
why an `ε`-rational plan has every ledger increment at most `ε`.

## What is proved

1. **The ledger.**  `quittingLedger`, its vanishing at `0`, its one-step
   recursion, the increment bound `2·bound` and hence `|W_i| ≤ i·(2·bound)`,
   and the per-stage `ε` bound under root endpoint `ε`-Nash.
2. **The clocks.**  `quittingLedgerStoppingIndex` (`i^n_∗`) in the
   `Nat.find`-with-`0`-default shape of `quittingPlannedSurvivalStoppingIndex`
   (`i^n_♯`, imported as is), the combinator `quittingPunishSwitchIndex` (`î`)
   as a `Finset.inf'` over players, the punish target
   `quittingPunishTarget` (`n̂`) preferring `i^n_♯`-achievers, and the
   consumer lemma `quittingLedger_lt_of_lt_quittingPunishSwitchIndex`: before
   the switch **no** player's ledger has reached `ε`.
3. **The feed-in.**  Against the always-Continue deviation the *global* gain
   is the opponent-survival-weighted ledger sum plus a survival-weighted
   remainder (`…_sub_eq_ledgerSum`), and Abel summation against the ledger cap
   turns that into the plan-phase cap
   (`…_quittingAlwaysContinueHazard_le_of_ledger_le`).  Specialised to the
   truncated plan the remainder vanishes and one gets literally hypothesis
   (a) of `quittingTerminalPayoff_update_quittingPhaseSwitchProfile_le`.

## The honest residual

The feed-in is stated with an explicit hypothesis `hdominate`: that every
hazard deviation is beaten by the always-Continue one up to `quitSlack`.
That hypothesis is exactly Simon's sentence "since quitting terminates the
game immediately and the one-stage advantage of doing so never exceeds
`ε⁴/(2M³)`, the only deviation to consider is repetitive continuing", and it
is **not** proved here: closing it is the rank-1 decision-discrepancy-process
argument of Propositions 1-2, a separate component.  Everything else on the
plan-phase side of Proposition 3 is discharged.
