# Boundary of the truncated-ledger reduction

`HasQuittingTruncatedLedgerCapPackage` is a sound sufficient certificate: a
package at every positive tolerance compiles to a uniform-equilibrium payoff.
It is not, however, a universal producer target.

The former declaration
`quittingGame_hasQuittingTruncatedLedgerCapPackage` asserted that every finite
quitting game with at least two players produced such packages.  The
counterexample in `QuittingTruncatedLedgerCapCounterexample` refutes that
statement on `Bool`.  Its reward is zero-sum: a singleton quitter receives
`-1`, the continuing opponent receives `1`, and simultaneous quitting pays
`0`.  All-Continue is an exact uniform equilibrium with payoff zero, but a
truncated ledger-cap package at tolerance `1/2` would force its common reach
parameter both above `1/2` and below `1/10`.

The obstruction is the certificate's common all-player deleted-survival
requirement, not equilibrium existence and not merely the absence of a
punishment tail.  The richer phase-switch package projects to the truncated
one and therefore has the same obstruction.  A complete producer must retain a
persistent-live branch (the landed zero-solo branch is one such class), or use
a weaker value-sensitive/active-set tail condition.  No exhaustiveness claim
for either repair is made here.

This module keeps the valid branch-relative reduction and the formal no-go.  It
contains no conjectural declaration.
