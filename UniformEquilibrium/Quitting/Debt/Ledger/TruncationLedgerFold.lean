# Folding the truncation correction into the plan phase

`QuittingPhaseSwitchResiduals.lean` records, but does not prove, the shape of
the discrepancy between a plan and its truncation at a cutoff: the value
curves differ, at *every* index up to the cutoff, by the joint survival from
that index to the cutoff times the discarded continuation value.  This file
proves that transfer and folds it into the one place it is consumed.

## The transfer, exactly

`quittingRootSequenceTerminalValue_quittingTruncatedRoots_eq_sub`:

`Ṽ_i = V_i − S(i, gap) · V_{i+gap}`,

with `S(i, gap)` the plan's own joint survival over the window.  The ledger
increment therefore transfers with an explicit correction
(`quittingLedgerStageAdvantage_quittingTruncatedRoots_eq_sub`):

`d̃_k = d_k − V_switch · (s_k · p_k · S(k+1, gap))`,

`s_k` the opponent-only continue mass and `p_k` the player's own prescribed
quit probability -- and summing gives the ledger transfer
`quittingLedger_quittingTruncatedRoots_eq_sub`.

## Why the raw ledger is the wrong place to fold

The correction sum is *not* small.  Each summand is a product of
probabilities, but the sum telescopes to roughly `1 − ∏_k (1 − p_k)`, so the
truncated ledger can exceed the plan's by the whole payoff range even when
the plan phase is reached with tiny probability.  The reason is that the
ledger is an *unweighted* sum of conditional advantages, and the correction
is concentrated at the late stages, which are reached with vanishing
probability.

What the assembly consumes is not the ledger but the plan-phase deviation
cap, which weighs each stage by the reach probability.  So the fold is done
one level up, on the values themselves: every deviation against the truncated
plan is a deviation against the plan, corrected by the reach probability
times a payoff-range term.  Concretely, for the three shapes the pure-time
reduction leaves:

* the always-Continue deviation and the plan's own value differ from their
  truncated counterparts by `reach ·(payoff range)` each;
* a quit date strictly before the cutoff gives *equal* values against the
  plan and against its truncation -- the deviated joint survival through the
  cutoff is zero, so the truncation removes nothing;
* a quit date at or past the cutoff is the always-Continue deviation plus one
  further reach-weighted term.

`quittingRootSequenceHazardTerminalValue_quittingTruncatedRoots_le_of_plan_ledger_le`
assembles them: the clock's bound on the *plan's* ledger, a quit-regret bound
before the cutoff, and a reach bound at the cutoff give hypothesis (a) with
error `ε + δ + reach · (5 · bound)`.

## Where the reach bound comes from, and where it does not

The reach bound `quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight plan who 0 switch ≤ reach` is
supplied in Simon's Case 2 by
`quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight_le_of_target_plannedSurvivalStoppingIndex`
(`QuittingPhaseSwitchResiduals.lean`): the punished player's own
planned-survival clock has crossed the threshold there, and that player is
one factor of every other player's opponent-survival product.

In Case 1 -- the switch achieved by a ledger clock rather than a survival
clock -- no such bound is available, and it stays an explicit hypothesis of
every theorem below.  Supplying it is the rank-one crossing-probability
estimate: its abstract layer is the one-sided decision-variation maximal
inequality of `Math/Probability/DecisionVariationMaximalInequality.lean`, but
the excursion infrastructure that would instantiate it -- the
decision-discrepancy process of a quitting plan, its excursions, and their
crossing counts -- does not exist in this repository, so no theorem here
claims it.

## Main results

* `quittingRootSequenceTerminalValue_quittingTruncatedRoots_eq_sub` -- the
  value transfer, with the correction explicit
* `quittingLedgerStageAdvantage_quittingTruncatedRoots_eq_sub`,
  `quittingLedger_quittingTruncatedRoots_eq_sub` -- the ledger transfer
* `quittingRootSequenceHazardTerminalValue_quittingTruncatedRoots_le_of_plan_ledger_le`
  -- hypothesis (a) from the plan's ledger and the reach bound
* `quittingTerminalPayoff_update_quittingPhaseSwitchProfile_le_of_plan_ledger_le`
  -- the assembled cap, fed entirely by quantities the clocks bound

/-! ## The folded plan-phase cap -/

/-- **Hypothesis (a) from the plan's own ledger.**  The clock bounds the
*plan's* ledger, not the truncated plan's; folding the truncation correction
into the reach probability turns that bound into the plan-phase hypothesis of
`quittingTerminalPayoff_update_quittingPhaseSwitchProfile_le`, at the cost of
`reach · (5 · bound)`.

The three hypotheses are exactly the three quantities the clocks and the
survival wiring produce: the ledger cap up to the switch, the quit regret
before it, and the reach probability at it.  The last is Case 2's; in Case 1
it is the open crossing estimate and stays a hypothesis here. -/

/-- **The assembled cap, fed by the clocks alone.**  The phase-switch
deviation cap whose plan phase is discharged by the *plan's* ledger, the
plan's quit regret before the switch, and the reach probability at the
switch -- the three quantities `QuittingLedgerPunishClock.lean`'s clocks and
`QuittingPhaseSwitchResiduals.lean`'s Case-2 wiring produce.  Hypothesis (b),
the punishment cap, is unchanged and remains hypothesised. -/
