# Reachable-capacity telescopes for carried dynamic debt

A chronological sequence of literally attached punishment-floor reachable
prepends runs opposite the charged relation: its current predecessor is
followed by the edge's tail.  The canonical reachable potential therefore
increases along chronological time. Subtracting it from a supplied finite
prefix-charge bound produces a remaining capacity that decreases by at least
the edge's joint absorption charge.

When the same sequence carries coherent exact dynamic-debt annotations, the
aggregate diagonal seam is at most `card * rewardBound` times that charge.
Scaling remaining capacity by this constant gives an excessive killed
account for aggregate debt.  Finite telescoping consumes every seam, but it
retains one survival-weighted far-end debt boundary.  The final theorem makes
domination of that boundary the exact remaining premise; reachability and
capacity alone do not provide it.
