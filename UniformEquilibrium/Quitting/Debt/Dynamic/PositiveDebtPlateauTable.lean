# A two-player table with a debt plateau inside the zero-pinned chain family

The table is

`r({1}) = (1/4, 0)`, `r({2}) = (1, -1/4)`, `r({1,2}) = (3/4, 1/4)`,

with `max 0 r_1({1}) = 1/4 > 0` and `max 0 r_2({2}) = 0`.

## What is shown

Within the *zero-pinned* exact zero-boundary Nash--Bellman chain family
(`quittingFiniteZeroBoundaryNashBellmanChainSet`, which forces the displayed
payoff to be exactly `0` at the chain's terminal state), the optimized
finite-chain dynamic debt stays bounded away from zero.  For every cutoff
`cutoff = m ≥ 1` we exhibit an explicit legal chain `plateauPath cutoff`
whose date-zero exact dynamic debt is literally `(1/8, 0)`, independent of
`cutoff`.  Its structure is:

* rows `0, …, m - 2` (if any) are the all-Continue root, carrying zero
  absorption mass and zero opponent-only hazard, and preserve a constant
  displayed payoff `(1/2, 0)`;
* row `m - 1`, the last row, is the exact (`ε = 0`) zero-tail Nash root at
  which both players Quit with probability one half.  It carries all of the
  chain's absorption mass, `3/4`.

The all-Continue prefix can be made arbitrarily long: the entire absorbing
mass recedes into a single terminal row as the cutoff grows, while the
date-zero debt itself stays pinned at `1/8`.

We prove this explicit chain is legal and compute its exact dynamic debt
directly, for both players, at every cutoff.  We do **not** prove that this
chain is the debt-minimizing chain at each cutoff; that stronger optimality
statement is not established here.  A hand computation (not formalized in
this file) suggests the zero-tail root at row `m - 1` is the *unique* exact
endpoint-Nash root against a zero continuation value for this table, which
would be the structural reason a minimizing search cannot avoid this
positive-debt row -- but that uniqueness claim itself carries no Lean proof
here and should be treated as an unverified hint, not a theorem.

## What is not shown

This file does **not** show that the underlying game is hard, and does
**not** show that equilibrium fails for this table.  The zero-boundary chain
family pins the terminal continuation to exactly `0`; an actual equilibrium
of the quitting game need not respect that pin, so it may lie entirely
outside the geometry this file explores.  Two-player quitting games are
known externally to admit stationary approximate equilibria for every
positive error (Solan--Vieille, *Quitting Games -- An Example*, 2002, §2.1,
citing Flesch--Thuijsman--Vrieze 1996), so nothing here suggests this table
poses any obstruction to approximate equilibrium.

The positive plateau proved below may simply be an artifact of pinning the
terminal continuation to zero rather than a property of the game.  A
by-hand (unformalized) check at the end of this file, done at the
coordinator's request, finds a candidate exact zero-debt stationary
equilibrium for this exact table once the terminal continuation is freed --
consistent with exactly that "pinning artifact" reading.  See the postscript
after `plateauPath_dynamicDebt` below for the computation and its caveats.

That check has since been turned into Lean theorems: the final section of
this file proves `stationaryRoot_isEndpointNash` (an exact, `ε = 0`,
endpoint-Nash certificate for the stationary row against its own value
`(1/4, 0)`) and `quittingConstantDynamicDebt_eq_zero` (the same dynamic-debt
recursion, run against that free continuation with terminal debt `0`, is
exactly zero at every fuel and start, for both players).  So the `1/8`
plateau is manufactured by the zero pin, not by the game.

positive cutoff, a legal zero-boundary exact Nash--Bellman chain whose
date-zero exact dynamic debt is literally `(1/8, 0)`, independent of the

minimum over all legal chains; no minimizer-optimality claim is made here. -/

/-! ## Postscript: a free-continuation stationary check (not formalized)

Everything above is about the *zero-pinned* chain family.  This postscript
reports a by-hand check of whether the plateau survives once the terminal
continuation is freed to a profile's own value, per the module docstring.
**None of this postscript is a Lean proof**; it is prose only, to be
verified or refuted by later formalization work.

Consider the stationary profile in which player one (`false`) Quits with
probability `1/2` every stage and player two (`true`) never Quits: hazards
`a = 1/2`, `b = 0`.

* `quittingTerminalPayoff_soloStationary` (already proved in
  `QuittingExceptionalTailFallback.lean`) gives the free terminal payoff of
  *any* stationary profile in which player one alone has positive hazard as
  exactly `quittingSoloReward reward false = (1/4, 0)`, independent of the
  specific positive hazard chosen; in particular this covers `a = 1/2`.
* Solving the general two-hazard fixed point directly (not restricted to
  positive `a`) gives the same value at `(a, b) = (1/2, 0)`: writing
  `W(a, b)` for the self-consistent stationary terminal payoff,
  `W_true(1/2, b) = 0` for *every* `b ∈ [0, 1]` (the numerator
  `b * (-1/4 + a/2)` vanishes identically at `a = 1/2`), and
  `W_false(1/2, 0) = 1/4`, matching the solo-stationary value exactly.
* Against that free continuation `(1/4, 0)`: player one's Quit and Continue
  endpoints coincide exactly (`1/4 = 1/4`), so player one is exactly
  indifferent to their own hazard, and in particular gains nothing from the
  discontinuous full-Continue deviation, which instead yields the strictly
  worse `(0, 0)` (`quittingTerminalPayoff_quittingAlwaysContinue`).  Player
  two's Quit endpoint against the same continuation is
  `-1/4 + a/2 = -1/4 + 1/4 = 0`, exactly matching player two's own Continue
  value `0`: player two is likewise exactly indifferent between Quitting
  and never Quitting.

Both players are therefore exactly indifferent to every one of their own
unilateral one-shot choices at this profile, which is the standard
signature of an exact stationary equilibrium.  If this check is right, the
positive plateau proved above is a pinning artifact of
`quittingFiniteZeroBoundaryNashBellmanChainSet`'s zero terminal boundary for
this table too, exactly as it was for the companion table referenced in the
module docstring, and not a hard instance.

**Caveats.**  This computation is not a Lean theorem, and the author caught
and corrected one own error while producing it: an initial claim that the
solo-Quit-by-player-two profile `(a, b) = (0, 1)` was an equilibrium is
wrong -- there player two has a strictly profitable deviation to never
Quitting (from `-1/4` up to `0`), missed by naively plugging `b = 1` into
the finite two-hazard fixed-point formula without checking that player
two's own fixed-opponents-continue-mass is exactly `1` there, which
invalidates that formula.  The `(a, b) = (1/2, 0)` computation above avoids
that specific trap (`a = 1/2 > 0` keeps every relevant continuation mass
strictly below `1`), and gives an *exact* (not merely approximate)
indifference on both sides, which is reassuring, but reaching a genuine
Lean theorem would still need the same kind of behavioral-deviation
case analysis as
`QuittingTerminalPacketSimpleFallbackCounterexample.no_stationary_exact_terminal_equilibrium`
uses to rule equilibria *out*, run in the opposite direction to rule one
*in*.  Treat the indifference computation above as a lead, not a result.

**Update.**  The endpoint half of the lead is no longer prose: the section
below formalizes it.  `stationaryRoot_isEndpointNash` is the exact
(`ε = 0`) endpoint-Nash certificate at `(a, b) = (1/2, 0)` against the free
continuation `(1/4, 0)`, `stationaryRoot_successor_eq` verifies that this
continuation is that row's own value (so the profile really is stationary),
and `quittingConstantDynamicDebt_eq_zero` computes the dynamic debt against
it as exactly `0` at every fuel and start, for both players.  What is still
prose is only the *behavioral* deviation analysis (deviations that are not
unilateral one-shot root deviations); the endpoint certificate is the same
kind of certificate the zero-pinned chain family above is built from, so it
is exactly the right comparison object for the plateau claim.

/-! ## The `1/8` plateau is manufactured by the zero pin

Everything before this point pins the terminal continuation to `0`.  Freeing
it to the game's own stationary value `(1/4, 0)` erases the plateau
completely.  The declarations here mirror
`QuittingBoundedSurgeryDescentCounterexample.stationaryRoot_isEndpointNash`
and `.quittingConstantDynamicDebt_eq_zero` for this table.
