# The exact transport law for the finite dynamic debt

`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt` is defined by a raw Bellman maximum, and
`QuittingFiniteDynamicDebtChains.lean` records only the coarse upper bound
`debt ≤ opponentSurvivalWeight * terminalDebt` obtained by discarding local
strictness.  This file records the exact backward recursion and its
unrolled closed form, valid under the same one-step residual-zero
hypothesis used by that bound.

At a live stage, define the *stage gap* `quittingStageGap` as how much the
fixed-opponents quit value exceeds the fixed-opponents continue value under
the prescribed tail.  Under residual-zero the raw Bellman maximum recursion
collapses to

`debt start (fuel + 1) = max 0 (continueMass * debt (start + 1) fuel -
  max 0 (stageGap start))`,

which is `quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_succ_eq_max_zero_stageGap`.  Unrolling
this from the terminal boundary gives the closed form

`debt start fuel = max 0 (survivalWeight * terminalDebt -
  Σ survivalWeight * max 0 stageGap)`,

which is `quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_eq_max_zero_sub_accumulatedStageGaps`.
Since the subtracted sum is nonnegative, this closed form immediately
implies the coarse survival-weighted bound; that implication is recorded as
a consistency check on the closed form, not as a replacement for the
existing theorem.

`HEADLINE` — all debt is transported terminal debt, less credit spendable
only where a coordinate is pure.  **The hypothesis `0 ≤ terminalDebt` is not
removable**: it fails on genuine absorbing cycles, so this law must not be
used to compute cyclic mismatch.  See `QuittingCycleMismatchContraction` for
