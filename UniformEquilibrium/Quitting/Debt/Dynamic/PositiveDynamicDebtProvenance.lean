# Provenance forced by positive exact dynamic debt

This file develops the local, selector-free part of positive-debt
provenance.  Positive exact debt propagates forward through every finite
exact-D edge.  At the last
live edge of a zero-boundary chain it forces a genuine positive-probability
opponent action whose *full simultaneous quitter set* gives the debt owner a
strictly larger payoff when the owner continues than when the owner joins the
same set of quitters.

This is a residual-depth-one terminal packet.  It is not singletonized, does
not choose a new owner, and is not claimed to be a terminal equilibrium or a
finite discharge.

vanishes, its uniquely selected stopping alternative is to Continue at every

recursive, expectation-level form of the exact first-opponent identity. -/
