# Exact dynamic debt on finite zero-boundary Nash--Bellman chains

This file puts the corrected exact Bellman debt directly on the compact
finite-chain space.  For a chain of length `K`, player `i`'s initial debt is
`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt` with terminal boundary
`max 0 (r({i})_i)`.  The aggregate objective is their finite sum.

The all-Continue extension of a zero-boundary chain is a genuine prescribed
value sequence.  Its local residual vanishes before the cutoff, which gives
localized nonnegativity and the terminal-cap bound needed to place every
backward debt state in `quittingDebtBox`.  Consecutive annotated states are
literal `IsQuittingDynamicDebtEdge`s.

No claim is made that the infimum of the exact-debt objectives is zero, nor
that this finite-chain architecture is dense in all terminal equilibria.

/-! ## Prescribed-value and residual interface -/

/-- A zero-boundary path's displayed value is zero from the cutoff onward.

This does *not* generalize to a nonzero anchor as a single statement: the
`time = cutoff` case genuinely needs the zero pin (it reads the path's own
terminal payoff, via `quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathValue_eq_zero_at_cutoff`),
while the `time > cutoff` case is purely structural
(`quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathValue_eq_zero_of_cutoff_lt`) and returns the
literal padding `0` regardless of anchor.  An anchored path with
`terminal ≠ 0` would disagree with itself across the two cases, so the
combined claim is specific to the zero boundary; only its two pieces
generalize. -/
