# Projective chronological limits of finite quitting debt tails

Repeated player flags need not advance time: they may only re-mark one
bounded-depth terminal packet.  This file therefore separates the elementary
residual-depth alternative before applying compactness.

When the residual depths genuinely tend to infinity, a family of actual
rooted finite tails in the compact debt box has a coordinatewise convergent
subsequence.  Closedness of the exact edge graph makes its limit one
chronologically compatible infinite debt tail.  If every fixed local loss
also tends to zero, all limit edges are zero-loss and inherit the finite
All-Continue/solo support classification.

No finite-graph recurrence, hazard divergence, or equilibrium conclusion is
claimed.
