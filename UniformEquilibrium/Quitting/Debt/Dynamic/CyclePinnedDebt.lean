# Dynamic debt against a realized cyclic continuation

The existing optimized finite-chain debt
`quittingFiniteZeroBoundaryNashBellmanMinMaxDynamicDebt` pins the terminal
continuation of every admissible chain to `0`.  On the surgery table of
`QuittingBoundedSurgeryDescentCounterexample` that pin manufactures a
strictly positive plateau `a(1 - a) / (1 - a^(m+1)) ↓ a(1 - a) > 0`, even
though the same game has an exact stationary equilibrium at which the debt
against its own continuation is exactly zero at every horizon
(`quittingConstantDynamicDebt_eq_zero`).

This file replaces the pin by a *realized* terminal continuation.

## The vacuity trap and how it is fenced

If the terminal continuation `z` were an arbitrary vector, the objective
would collapse: choosing `z` so that the terminal debt is `0` makes the whole
debt identically `0` for every chain, by
`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_eq_zero_of_terminalDebt_eq_zero`.  Three fences
are used, and all three are needed.

1. **`z` must be self-consistent.**  `IsQuittingCyclicContinuation` demands a
   finite block of Nash--Bellman points of length `L ≥ 1` which is run
   against `z` at its terminal end and *reproduces* `z` at its origin.
2. **The block must absorb.**  *This hypothesis is not redundant and must not
   be removed.*  Take the all-Continue row, at which every player continues
   with probability one.  Its all-continue mass is `1` and every absorbing
   coalition has probability `0`, so its Bellman map is the **identity**:
   `quittingRootSuccessorPayoff reward z quittingAllContinueRoot = z` for
   *every* `z` (`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff_allContinueRoot_eq`).  It is also
   exactly endpoint Nash against every `z` dominating the solo-quit rewards,
   since the endpoint difference is `r({i})_i - z_i`
   (`quittingAllContinueRoot_isZeroNash_of_singleton_le`).  So without
   fence 2 the all-Continue block would certify an essentially arbitrary
   vector -- e.g. the constant reward bound, cf. the phantom spine of
   `canonicalPhantom_isExactQuittingNashBellmanSpine` -- as a "realized"
   continuation, and its terminal mismatch would be `0`, making the whole
   objective vacuously zero.  `quittingAllContinueBlock_forced` records
   exactly this: the all-Continue block satisfies *every other clause* of the
   predicate and fails only absorption.  Requiring one stage of the block to
   have positive `quittingRootAbsorptionMass` makes the block's affine
   fixed-point equation nondegenerate, so `z` is *determined* by the block
   rather than chosen; see
   `quittingCyclicContinuation_value_eq_of_absorbing_period_one`.
3. **The terminal debt is not free either.**  It is
   `quittingTerminalContinuationMismatch`, the positive part of the solo-quit
   deviation gain *measured against `z`*.  At `z = 0` this is literally the
   existing `quittingPositiveSingletonDebtCap`
   (`quittingTerminalContinuationMismatch_zero`), so the construction
   specializes to the existing zero-pinned debt
   (`quittingCyclePinnedDynamicDebt_zero`) rather than replacing it.

## Which existing chain grammar is reused, and why

The block and the chain are both members of
`quittingFiniteAnchoredNashBellmanChainSet`, which is
`quittingFiniteZeroBoundaryNashBellmanChainSet` with the hard-coded terminal
value `0` promoted to a parameter; `quittingFiniteAnchoredNashBellmanChainSet
reward 0 = quittingFiniteZeroBoundaryNashBellmanChainSet reward` holds by
`rfl`.  Its per-stage exactness condition is the unmodified
`IsQuittingNashBellmanEdge`: the displayed value equals
`quittingRootSuccessorPayoff` of the next displayed value under the stage
root, and the stage root is *exactly* (`ε = 0`) endpoint Nash against the
next displayed value.  That is the right notion here precisely because it is
the same one the zero-pinned family is graded against: the only difference
between the two families is which vector sits at the far end, so any debt gap
between them is attributable to the boundary and to nothing else.

## What is not claimed

`quittingTerminalContinuationMismatch` is the exact analogue of the existing
terminal cap -- a one-step solo-quit gain against the boundary vector -- and
not a proven envelope for the full exploitability of the infinitely repeated
block.  No optimization over the cycle-pinned family is defined here, and no
compactness or attainment statement is made about it.

General nonnegativity of the cycle-pinned debt is not proved *in this file*.
The reason is an API limitation rather than a mathematical one:
`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_nonneg` wants `IsQuittingLivePrescribedValue`,
which is a condition at *every* time, while
`quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathValue` and `quittingFiniteNashBellmanPathRoots`
pad beyond the cutoff with `0` and all-Continue -- a padding that is coherent
only for the zero boundary.  The debt itself never reads that padding (the
recursion is run with fuel `cutoff - time`, and
`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_congr` below localizes it), but the global
hypothesis is unavailable here.  The periodic extension of the anchored chain
by its own cyclic block supplies it, and is built in
`QuittingCyclicPeriodicExtension`; nonnegativity is
`quittingCyclePinnedDynamicDebt_nonneg` there.

Uniqueness of the realized continuation is likewise proved only at period one
below (`quittingCyclicContinuation_unique_of_absorbing_period_one`); the
general-period form is `quittingCyclicContinuation_unique_of_absorbing` in the
same downstream file.

`IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock` already states absorption, but it is a
*Prop*: a semantic consumer that merely names the Prop as a hypothesis type
can just as easily be restated, elsewhere, against a differently-shaped
hypothesis that drops the absorption conjunct -- exactly the omission
`quittingAllContinueBlock_forced` shows is silent and passes every other
clause.  `QuittingRealizedContinuation` closes that off at the type level for
every consumer that is phrased in terms of it: absorption is a *field*, so a
term of this structure cannot exist without a proof of absorption baked in,
and there is no route to one except through `IsQuittingCyclicContinuationBlock`
itself (`QuittingRealizedContinuation.ofBlock`) or an equivalent direct
construction that still has to supply the `absorbs` field. -/
