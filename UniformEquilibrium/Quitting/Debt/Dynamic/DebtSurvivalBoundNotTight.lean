# The survival-times-terminal dynamic-debt bound is not tight

`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt_le_survival_mul_terminalDebt_on`
(`FiniteDynamicDebtChains.lean`) proves

`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt reward roots who prescribed terminalDebt start fuel ≤
  quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight roots who start fuel * terminalDebt`

whenever `prescribed` is a genuine live prescribed value and every local
residual vanishes on the examined window.  This is an **upper** bound only,
and this file records that no reverse inequality holds: there is no constant
`κ > 0` with

`κ * (quittingOpponentSurvivalWeight roots who start fuel * terminalDebt) ≤
  quittingFiniteDynamicDebt reward roots who prescribed terminalDebt start fuel`

in general.

## Mechanism

`quittingFiniteDynamicDebt` is a backward Bellman recursion built from a
`max` between a "stop now" alternative and a "continue, carrying the
transported debt forward" alternative.  A `max` can only ever *truncate*: it
never amplifies.  Once the stopping alternative's clean value already meets
or exceeds what continuing (plus whatever debt has accumulated downstream)
would deliver, the `max` selects the stopping branch outright and the
transported debt is discharged to nothing, no matter how large the surviving
terminal debt is.  There is no mechanism that could make the debt *exceed*
its survival-weighted cap, but there is nothing preventing it from being
annihilated far below that cap either.

## The witness

Two players over `Bool`.  Player `false` (`who`) is the tracked debt owner:
its prescribed policy quits for certain at the one examined stage.  Player
`true` (the opponent) continues for certain at every stage, so the opponent
survival weight is exactly `1` on every window.  The reward table gives the
solo-quitter `false` a terminal payoff of `1` and every other terminal
configuration `0`.

At the examined stage, `false`'s prescribed value already equals the pure
quit payoff `1`; the alternative of continuing (with the transported
terminal debt `terminalDebt = 1` added in) reaches exactly `1` as well, so
the `max` still selects `1` and no residual debt survives.  The dynamic debt
is exactly `0`, while the survival-weighted terminal debt is `1 · 1 = 1`.

## Deviation from the naively transcribed witness

A tempting simplification -- both players stay in these same pure actions
*forever*, not just at the examined stage -- does **not** work: it forces
the prescribed value to be constant and forces the "stop" and "continue"
branches to coincide identically (a bare tie, not a strict gap), so a
positive transported debt is *never* discharged and instead propagates
backward completely unchanged.  See `not_stationary_forever_witness` below
for the literal Lean confirmation.  The fix used here keeps the opponent's
"always continue" behavior exactly as stated (so the survival weight is
genuinely `1` on every window, not just the examined one), but lets the
debt owner's own prescribed policy return to `0` immediately after the
examined stage, which is enough to open a strict gap at that one stage
without disturbing the survival-weight computation at all.

bound on the dynamic debt: this witness already has dynamic debt `0` while
its survival-weighted terminal debt is the strictly positive value `1`. -/

/-! ## Confirmation that a literally-stationary witness does not work -/

/-- If instead the debt owner quit with certainty at *every* stage (not
just the examined one, as the naive de-gamed transcription suggested), the
prescribed value would be forced constant at `1` and the stopping branch
would exactly tie the continuing branch at every stage.  A tie never
discharges a positive transported debt against a Continue mass of `1`: it
transports it forward completely unchanged.  This confirms the literal
"quits forever" witness does **not** produce truncation; the fix used above
keeps the opponent's "always continue" behavior but returns the owner's own
prescribed policy to `0` immediately after the one examined stage. -/
