# Two-ended compactification of finite exact-D chains

The ordinary projective limit of the selected finite exact-D minimizers keeps
every fixed distance from the initial root.  It necessarily forgets every
fixed distance from the zero boundary.  This file retains both views at once:

* a forward ray, indexed by distance from the initial root; and
* a reverse ray, indexed by distance from the terminal zero boundary.

The two rays are extracted along one common subsequence.  The forward ray has
ordinary exact-D edges.  The reverse ray has exact-D edges in the opposite
index direction and starts on the literal zero-payoff, singleton-cap terminal
face.  Positive optimized debt selects one owner who remains positive at
reverse depth one, where the terminal edge supplies a quantitative full-action
opponent-advantage packet.

This is deliberately only the **unscaled two-end core**.  It does not retain
bridge-survival products, convergence of a preselected terminal action or its
transported cylinder mass, a bi-infinite orbit, a splice between the two ends,
or an equilibrium repair.  Those require a separate bridge/holonomy theorem.
