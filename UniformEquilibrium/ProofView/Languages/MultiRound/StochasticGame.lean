# Stochastic Games

A stochastic game (Shapley, 1953) extends a normal-form game with states
and probabilistic transitions between states depending on the joint action.

## Main definitions

* `StochasticGame` — stochastic game with states, actions, and transitions
* `StochasticGame.MarkovStrategy` — stationary (Markov) strategy
* `StochasticGame.stagePayoff` — single-stage expected payoff
* `StochasticGame.stageKernelGame` — stage game at a state as a `KernelGame`

## Main results

* `isStagewiseNash_iff_all_stage_nash` — stagewise Nash ↔ stage-game Nash at every state

The current equilibrium API is deliberately myopic: it does not yet aggregate
discounted continuation payoffs. `transition` and `discount` support
that future dynamic development.
