# Bridging finite-horizon-average payoffs to the liminf- and limsup-average games

`UniformEquilibrium.ProofView.Concepts.Stochastic.Equilibrium.Uniform` states
`IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` entirely in terms of **finite-horizon averages**
`finiteAveragePayoff s₀ T σ`
for `T ≥ T₀`.  The non-existence literature (e.g. Simon's Mousetrap preprint,
whose claimed counterexample was later retracted; what survives is the
order-of-limits distinction between expected-liminf payoffs and limits of
finite averages, which is what this file bridges) is stated for the
**liminf-average** game instead: the payoff of an infinite
play `ω` is `liminf_T A_T ω`, where `A_T ω` is the average of the first `T`
stage payoffs realized along `ω`, and the game-theoretic payoff is the
expectation `E[liminf_T A_T]` of that pathwise quantity under the measure
induced by a fixed profile. The **limsup-average** game replaces `liminf_T`
by `limsup_T` in that same payoff functional; nothing else about the setup
changes.

This file supplies the bridge between `finiteAveragePayoff` and both
tail-average notions, in two layers. The abstract lemmas
(`integral_liminf_le_of_bounded_of_eventually_le`,
`le_integral_liminf_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le`, and their
limsup duals `le_integral_limsup_of_bounded_of_eventually_le`,
`integral_limsup_le_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le`) work at the
level of generality the bridge actually needs: an arbitrary probability
space `(Ω, μ)` carrying a uniformly bounded family `A : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` of the
finite-horizon averages of one fixed profile, realized pathwise. They stay
fully general and do not mention `StochasticGame` at all.

The game-facing corollaries specialize `(Ω, μ)` to `G.Play` and
`G.infinitePlayMeasure`
(`UniformEquilibrium.ProofView.Concepts.Stochastic.Core.Probability.InfinitePlayMeasure`)
— the measure built by the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem from `G`'s transition
kernel and a fixed behavior profile — and `A` to `G.pathwiseAveragePayoff`,
the finite-horizon average payoff realized pathwise along an infinite play.
`StochasticGame.integral_pathwiseAveragePayoff` (via the projection property
`StochasticGame.map_histOfPlay_infinitePlayMeasure`) proves this process's
expectation at every horizon is exactly `finiteAveragePayoff`, so both
corollaries below are unconditional in their realization: neither assumes a
process representing the finite-horizon averages.

## Two directions, two different stories

* **Deviation direction (closed).**
  `integral_liminf_le_of_bounded_of_eventually_le` is real Fatou for a
  uniformly bounded family, composed with the trivial fact that `liminf` of
  an eventually-bounded sequence respects the bound. Applied to a fixed
  unilateral deviation, this gives `E[liminf_T A_T] ≤ v_i + 2ε` directly from
  `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`
  (`StochasticGame.deviation_liminf_le_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff`) once
  the deviation profile's pathwise realization is supplied.

* **On-path direction (conditional).** The reverse bound
  `E_σ[liminf_T A_T] ≥ v_i - ε` does **not** follow from pinned expectations
  alone: a uniformly bounded sequence of expectations converging to `L` can
  have `liminf_T A_T ω = 0` pathwise almost everywhere (the standard "moving
  bump"/typewriter-sequence construction: a sequence of events of constant
  positive probability that slides across the sample space, so every point
  is eventually excluded infinitely often, while also being covered
  infinitely often). Boundedness already gives uniform integrability for
  free on a probability space, so **uniform integrability is not the missing
  hypothesis**. What suffices is **almost-sure convergence** of `A_T` to a
  limit: then `liminf_T A_T = lim_T A_T` a.e., and the dominated convergence
  theorem (using the same uniform bound) upgrades convergence of
  expectations to convergence of the integral of the a.e. limit, which is
  the integral of the liminf.
  `le_integral_liminf_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le` states and
  proves this conditional form;
  `StochasticGame.onPath_le_liminf_integral_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff`
  instantiates it against `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`.

## What the pair does and does not give

Together the two directions do **not** make the finite-horizon-average
notion and the liminf-average notion interchangeable. Without the on-path
direction's extra hypothesis:

* a non-existence theorem for the liminf-average game does **not** formally
  refute `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` — the deviation direction alone only
  shows our notion's deviation payoffs cannot *exceed* the liminf-average
  deviation cap, which is the wrong direction for a refutation to bite; and
* existence of a uniform equilibrium payoff does **not** formally deliver a
  liminf-average equilibrium payoff — the on-path lower bound is exactly the
  missing half, and it costs a genuine extra hypothesis (a.s. convergence)
  that a bare uniform equilibrium payoff does not supply.

## The limsup dual, and the asymmetry it makes explicit

Negation exchanges `liminf` and `limsup` pointwise
(`liminf_neg_eq_neg_limsup`), unconditionally: no boundedness or convergence
hypothesis is needed for that identity by itself, since `Real.sSup`/
`Real.sInf` already return the junk value `0` on unbounded or empty sets,
consistently with negation. Applying each of the two abstract lemmas above
to `-A` therefore produces a dual pair, stated for `limsup` instead of
`liminf`, with **no change to the ENNReal/`ofReal` machinery inside either
proof** — the sign flip is absorbed entirely by
`liminf_neg_eq_neg_limsup` and `MeasureTheory.integral_neg`, applied once
each, from the outside:

* `le_integral_limsup_of_bounded_of_eventually_le` is the dual of
  `integral_liminf_le_of_bounded_of_eventually_le`. It is **unconditional**:
  negation turns "eventually `∫ A_n ≤ bound`" into "eventually
  `bound ≤ ∫ A_n`", and Fatou dualizes to reverse Fatou
  (`limsup E[A_n] ≤ E[limsup A_n]`) without picking up any new hypothesis.
* `integral_limsup_le_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le` is the dual
  of `le_integral_liminf_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le`, and it
  stays **conditional** on the same a.s.-convergence hypothesis: negation
  relabels which sign of inequality needs the hypothesis, it does not
  remove it. The moving-bump construction refutes the unconditional form
  here too, by the same negation: a constant sequence of expectations
  `1/2` with `limsup_T A_T ω = 1` and `liminf_T A_T ω = 0` at every `ω`
  satisfies "eventually `E[A_T] ≤ bound`" at `bound = 1/2`, while
  `E[limsup_T A_T] = 1 > bound`.

So the two liminf-side game corollaries have exact limsup-side twins with
the **same** free/conditional split, mirrored rather than doubled:
`onPath_le_limsup_integral_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` is unconditional
— it is the *on-path* bound, not the deviation bound — and
`deviation_limsup_le_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` is conditional on
`hconv` — it is the *deviation* bound, not the on-path bound. This is the
opposite pairing from the liminf game, not an extra free direction:

| Notion   | Deviation (upper bound on `E[·]`)  | On-path/delivery (lower bound)     |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| liminf   | unconditional (Fatou)               | conditional on a.s. convergence     |
| limsup   | conditional on a.s. convergence     | unconditional (reverse Fatou)       |

Consequently `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` does **not** transfer to the
limsup-average notion in both directions for free: swapping the aggregation
from liminf to limsup only swaps *which* of the two directions is free: it
does not make both free at once. Each notion gets exactly one unconditional
half and one conditional half, and the two notions' free halves are duals
of each other under `A ↦ -A`.

## Main definitions and results

  uniformly bounded family, composed with an eventual expectation bound
* `le_integral_liminf_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le` — the
  on-path converse, conditional on almost-sure convergence
* `liminf_neg_eq_neg_limsup` — negation exchanges `liminf` and `limsup`
  pointwise, unconditionally
* `le_integral_limsup_of_bounded_of_eventually_le` — the unconditional
  limsup dual of the deviation-direction Fatou lemma; the on-path bound in
  the limsup game
* `integral_limsup_le_of_bounded_of_tendsto_ae_of_eventually_le` — the
  limsup dual of the on-path lemma, conditional on almost-sure convergence;
  the deviation bound in the limsup game
* `StochasticGame.pathwiseAveragePayoff` — the finite-horizon average payoff
  realized pathwise along an infinite play
* `StochasticGame.integral_pathwiseAveragePayoff` — its expectation against
  `infinitePlayMeasure` is exactly `finiteAveragePayoff`
* `StochasticGame.deviation_liminf_le_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` — the
  deviation direction instantiated against `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`,
  unconditionally (given a bound on stage payoffs)
* `StochasticGame.onPath_le_liminf_integral_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` —
  the on-path direction instantiated against `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`,
  conditional on the same almost-sure convergence hypothesis as before
* `StochasticGame.onPath_le_limsup_integral_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` —
  the on-path direction in the limsup game, unconditionally

  deviation direction in the limsup game, conditional on almost-sure
  convergence of the deviation profile's own pathwise realization

No boundedness or convergence hypothesis is needed: `Real.sSup`/`Real.sInf`
already return the junk value `0` on unbounded or empty sets, consistently
with negation, so the identity holds for every `u` and every filter `f`.
This is the single fact that lets the limsup lemmas below be obtained from
