# Punishment (Min-Max) Levels and Individual Rationality

Every classical construction of uniform equilibrium is built on threats: a
deviating player is punished down to their **min-max (punishment) level**,
the best payoff they can guarantee once every other player coordinates to
minimize it.  This file supplies that notion for stochastic games under
finite-horizon average payoffs — the payoff aggregation
`HasUniformDeviationCapConstructor` quantifies over — and proves the
standard necessary condition: a uniform equilibrium payoff is
**individually rational**, i.e. it is at least each player's punishment
level.

No limit theory is used.  The punishment level is defined at each finite
horizon `T` exactly as `finiteAveragePayoff` is; the necessary condition is
proved with the same `∀ε>0, ∃T₀, ∀T≥T₀` quantifier shape that
`IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` already carries.

## Main definitions

* `StochasticGame.bestResponseAverageAgainstProfile` — the best average
  payoff `who` can secure at horizon `T` by unilaterally replacing their own
  coordinate of a fixed profile `τ`
* `StochasticGame.punishmentLevel` — player `who`'s punishment (min-max)
  level at horizon `T`: the infimum of the above over every profile `τ`
* `StochasticGame.IsIndividuallyRational` / `StochasticGame.IsεIndividuallyRational` —
  a payoff vector dominates (resp. `ε`-dominates) every player's punishment
  level at a horizon

## Main results

* `StochasticGame.punishmentLevel_le_add_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` — a
  uniform equilibrium payoff eventually `ε`-dominates one player's
  punishment level
* `StochasticGame.eventually_isεIndividuallyRational_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` —
  the vector form: a uniform equilibrium payoff is eventually
  `ε`-individually-rational, simultaneously for every player
* `StochasticGame.not_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_punishmentLevel_gt` — the
  no-go generator: a payoff held below a player's punishment level at every
  sufficiently large horizon is not a uniform equilibrium payoff

/-- **Individual rationality, one player at a time.**  If `v` is a uniform
equilibrium payoff of `G` from `s₀`, then for every `ε > 0` there is a
horizon threshold past which player `who`'s punishment level never exceeds
`v who + ε`.

The argument: at accuracy `ε/2`, `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` supplies a
profile `σ` and horizon threshold `T₀` past which `σ` is an `ε/2`-Nash
equilibrium with on-path payoff within `ε/2` of `v`.  No unilateral
deviation from `σ` then beats `v who + ε`, so the best-response value
against `σ`'s own coordinates for the other players is itself at most
`v who + ε`; the punishment level, being the *least* best-response value
over *every* profile, is therefore at most `v who + ε` as well.

Read contrapositively: a player held strictly below their punishment level
has, by definition of that level, a deviation beating the prescribed payoff
by a fixed margin — contradicting the deviation cap that a uniform
equilibrium payoff supplies at every sufficiently long horizon. -/

/-- **Individual rationality.**  If `v` is a uniform equilibrium payoff of
`G` from `s₀`, then for every `ε > 0` there is a horizon threshold past
which `v` is `ε`-individually rational: simultaneously for every player,
the punishment level never exceeds that player's payoff by more than `ε`.

This is the necessary condition every uniform equilibrium payoff satisfies,
and the no-go generator dual to it: any candidate payoff held below some
player's punishment level by more than a fixed margin, at arbitrarily large
horizons, is refuted (`not_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_punishmentLevel_gt`
below). -/

/-- **No-go generator.**  If a player's punishment level exceeds a candidate
payoff by more than a fixed margin `ε` at every horizon past `N`, that
payoff is not a uniform equilibrium payoff.  This is the direct corollary
of individual rationality used to refute a concrete candidate payoff table:
exhibit one player and one margin for which the punishment level of a
concrete reward table stays that far above the candidate. -/
