# Feasible Payoffs for Stochastic Games

The third item of the folk-theorem bill for stochastic games: `feasibleSet`
for `StochasticGame`, matching `KernelGame.feasibleSet`
(`UniformEquilibrium.ProofView.Concepts.Welfare.FolkTheorem.Feasible`) at the stochastic level.

Two feasible sets are supplied, at the two payoff aggregations already used
by the uniform-equilibrium program:

* `StochasticGame.finiteFeasibleSet` — the finite-horizon feasible set: the
  range of `finiteAveragePayoff` over behavior profiles, at a fixed horizon.
  Unlike `KernelGame.feasibleSet` this is **not** a convex hull: public
  randomization is not part of the model, so nothing convexifies the range of
  independent behavior profiles (`Feasible.FiniteFeasibleSetNotConvex`
  exhibits a two-player instance where it genuinely fails to be convex).
* `StochasticGame.IsAsymptoticFeasible` / `StochasticGame.asymptoticFeasibleSet`
  — the asymptotic feasible set: payoffs approximated, at every accuracy, by
  *some* profile at all sufficiently large horizons.  Its quantifier shape
  matches `StochasticGame.IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` exactly (drop the
  Nash conjunct), so every uniform equilibrium payoff is asymptotically
  feasible almost by definition
  (`isAsymptoticFeasible_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff`).

Combined with the landed individual-rationality necessary condition
(`eventually_isεIndividuallyRational_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff` in
`PunishmentLevel.lean`), this gives the full folk-theorem necessary
direction in one theorem:
`isAsymptoticFeasible_and_eventually_isεIndividuallyRational_of_isUniformEquilibriumPayoff`.

For the quitting game, `finiteFeasibleSet_quittingGame_subset_convexHull`
relates the feasible set to the reward table: every finite-horizon feasible
vector is a convex combination of the coalition reward vectors *and the zero
vector*, the zero vector standing for the horizon share spent still active
(not yet absorbed).  This is an unconditional inclusion, not an equality —
whether every point of that hull is itself attained by some profile is a
separate, harder question this file does not address.

/-- The finite-horizon feasible set at horizon `T` from `s₀`: every payoff
vector attainable by some behavior profile's expected average payoff over
the first `T` stages.  There is no convex hull here (contrast
`KernelGame.feasibleSet`): public randomization plays no role in the
behavior-strategy model, so nothing correlates independent players'
randomizations beyond what a single behavior profile already supplies. -/

`KernelGame` whose strategies are whole behavior strategies).  There is no
separate `convexHull` step because a `StochasticGame`'s strategies already
*are* the horizon game's strategies — the two feasible-set notions coincide
exactly where `KernelGame.feasibleSet` would take a convex hull of
`purePayoffSet` to account for correlation that the model does not have. -/

is `3pq - p - q + 1` and the column player's is `3pq - 2p - 2q + 2` — the
classical bimatrix independent-mixing formula. -/

/-- **`finiteFeasibleSet` is not convex.**  The two coordination payoffs
`(2, 1)` and `(1, 2)` are both feasible at horizon `1`, but their midpoint
`(3/2, 3/2)` is not: writing `p, q` for the two players' probabilities of
`true`, feasibility of the midpoint forces `p + q = 1` and `p * q = 1 / 2`
simultaneously, so `(p - q)^2 = -1`, impossible for reals.  Public
randomization would fix this (a coin flip choosing between the two pure
coordination profiles reaches the midpoint exactly), but it is not part of
the behavior-strategy model. -/
