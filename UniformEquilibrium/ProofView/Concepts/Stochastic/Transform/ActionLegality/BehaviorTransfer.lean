# The padded game and the behaviour-level legality transfer, restricted to legal play

`ActionLegalityNormalization.lean` normalizes a *stage*: `normStagePayoff`/
`normTransition` replace illegal action components before evaluating
`G.stagePayoff`/`G.transition`, and the Markov-level correspondence between
the legality-constrained stage game and its normalization is proved there and
in `ActionLegalityMarkovConverse.lean`.  Neither file assembles the
normalization into an actual `StochasticGame` value, and neither reaches the
behaviour-strategy machinery (`BehaviorProfile`/`Hist`/`histDist`) of
`Basic.lean` / `Uniform.lean`, which is what
`StochasticGame.IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` is built on.  This file does both.

## What closes

* `StochasticGame.normalizedGame` — deliverable (1): the padding construction
  itself, an actual `StochasticGame` value with `Act := G.Act` (already
  state-independent) and every action legal everywhere.
* `StochasticGame.finiteAveragePayoff_normalizedGame_eq_of_isLegalBehaviorProfile`
  — deliverable (2), lifted from a single stage to whole trajectories: a
  behavior profile that **unconditionally** plays only legal actions (at
  every history it is fed, reachable or not) induces the *same* history
  distribution and the *same* finite-horizon payoffs in `G` and in its
  padding.  No history-observability argument is needed for this lemma: an
  unconditionally-legal profile never plays an illegal-looking action, so
  there is nothing for the padded game's bookkeeping to disagree with `G`
  about.
* `StochasticGame.isεLegalHorizonNash_normalizedGame_iff` and
  `StochasticGame.isLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff_normalizedGame_iff` —
  deliverable (3)'s two-directional transfer, for the notions
  `IsεLegalHorizonNash` / `IsLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff` defined below:
  ε-Nash (resp. uniform equilibrium payoff) **against legal deviations only,
  by a profile that is itself unconditionally legal** transfers in both
  directions between `G` and `G.normalizedGame`.  This is a genuine two-sided
  iff, not a one-sided containment: restricting both the prescribed profile
  and every deviation to legality on both sides of the correspondence makes
  the two notions the same mathematical object by deliverable (2), so nothing
  is lost either way.

## What does not close, and exactly why

The consequence the padding reduction is supposed to deliver is stronger:
take the **unrestricted** witness contemplated by the general conjecture for
an arbitrary state-independent game, hence for `G.normalizedGame`, and produce
a *legal* equilibrium of `G`. That
witness `σ` is an arbitrary `BehaviorProfile` with no legality guarantee at
all, on-path or under deviation, so this needs the converse of
`isεLegalHorizonNash_normalizedGame_iff`'s restricted statement: from an
**unrestricted** `(G.normalizedGame ...).IsεHorizonNash s₀ T ε σ`, produce a
legal profile with matching (or matching-up-to-`ε`) legal-restricted Nash
behaviour in `G`.

The natural repair is projection: replace `σ`'s output at every `(i, t, h)`
by its normalization, `σ♮ i t h := (σ i t h).map (normalize1 h.2 i)`, which is
unconditionally legal by construction.  This repair does **not** go through,
and the reason is a specific, checkable failure of a coupling argument, not
just the general "labels are a public signal" intuition recorded in
`ActionLegalityMarkovConverse.lean`.

Concretely: relating `(G.normalizedGame ...).histDist σ♮ s₀ t` to
`(G.normalizedGame ...).histDist σ s₀ t` by induction on `t` requires, at the
inductive step, evaluating `σ♮` (equivalently `σ`) at a history `h` drawn from
`histDist σ♮ s₀ t` — which, by the induction hypothesis, is *already*
normalized (all-legal), i.e. `h = normalizeHist h₀` for some raw `h₀` in the
support of `histDist σ s₀ t`.  But `σ♮ i t h := (σ i t h).map (normalize1 h.2
i)` looks up `σ` **at `h` itself** (the normalized history), not at the raw
`h₀` that `σ`'s own trajectory would have produced.  Since `normalizeAct` is
generally non-injective (many raw histories collapse to the same normalized
one), there is no way to recover `h₀` from `h`, and an arbitrary `σ` need not
satisfy `σ i t (normalizeHist h₀) = σ i t h₀` — nothing forces a profile to be
insensitive to whether the history it is fed carries raw or already-legal
labels. So `σ♮`'s own induced trajectory is not controlled by `σ`'s cap
property at all past the first stage, and the projection carries no
guarantee forward.  This is the exact mechanism behind the informal
"illegal labels are a costless public signal" diagnosis in
`ActionLegalityMarkovConverse.lean`: it is not merely that opponents *could*
react to a raw illegal label, it is that **no expression built from `σ`
alone can even be evaluated at the history a legality-respecting profile
would actually reach**, because that history was never in `σ`'s domain of
observed behaviour to begin with.

Fixing this needs a strategy space that is *structurally* insensitive to
illegal labels — the "normalized-action histories" repair the pipeline
identifies as load-bearing, where a strategy only ever observes a legal
history and the *type* rules out feeding it a raw one. That is a
substantially larger undertaking (redefining `Hist`/`histDist` themselves, not
just adding a legality side-condition on `BehaviorProfile`) and is not
attempted here. Consequently `UniformExistenceConjecture.lean`'s scope note
is unchanged by this file: the conjecture is still formally stated for the
state-independent class only.

## Main definitions

* `StochasticGame.normalizedGame` — the padded game: same state and action
  types, normalized stage payoff and transition, every action legal
  everywhere
* `StochasticGame.IsLegalBehaviorStrategy` / `IsLegalBehaviorProfile` — a
  strategy/profile that plays only legal actions, unconditionally on every
  history it could be fed
* `StochasticGame.IsεLegalHorizonNash` — ε-Nash of the `T`-stage game,
  restricted on both sides to legal play: legal prescribed profile, legal
  deviations only
* `StochasticGame.IsLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff` — the legal-play uniform
  equilibrium payoff notion built on `IsεLegalHorizonNash`

## Main results

* `StochasticGame.jointlyLegal_of_mem_support_stageActionDist` — an
  unconditionally legal profile's joint action at any history is jointly
  legal
* `StochasticGame.legal_of_mem_support_histDist` — every stage recorded in a
  history reached under a legal profile is itself legal
* `StochasticGame.histDist_normalizedGame_eq_of_isLegalBehaviorProfile` /
  `totalPayoff_normalizedGame_eq_of_isLegalBehaviorProfile` /
  `finiteAveragePayoff_normalizedGame_eq_of_isLegalBehaviorProfile` —
  deliverable (2): exact trajectory, per-history payoff, and finite-average
  payoff agreement between `G` and `G.normalizedGame` for legal profiles
* `StochasticGame.isεLegalHorizonNash_normalizedGame_iff` /
  `isLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff_normalizedGame_iff` — deliverable (3): the
  two-directional legal-play transfer
