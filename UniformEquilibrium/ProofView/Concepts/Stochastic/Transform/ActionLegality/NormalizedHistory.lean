# Normalized histories: a quotient of `Hist` that cannot see illegal labels

`ActionLegalityBehaviorTransfer.lean` records why the padding reduction's
unrestricted converse does not close by projecting an arbitrary behavior
profile through `normalizeAct`: histories record the *raw* joint action, so
the projected profile's own trajectory is not controlled by the original
profile's cap property, since `normalizeAct` is non-injective and the raw
predecessor of an already-normalized history cannot be recovered. This file
builds the repair that module's docstring identifies as load-bearing: a
strategy space that is *structurally* insensitive to illegal labels, added
additively (`Hist`, `StageRecord`, `histDist` in `Basic.lean` are untouched).

## The quotient, and why a subtype

`normalizeHist` applies `normalizeAct` to every recorded stage of a history
(the current state is untouched, since `Legal` has no opinion about it). Its
image -- equivalently its fixed points (`normalizeHist_idem`), equivalently
the histories every one of whose recorded stages is already jointly legal
(`IsNormalizedHist`) -- is packaged as `NormalizedHist`, a **subtype** of
`Hist t`, not a `Quotient`. Idempotence gives every "same normalization"
class a canonical representative already living in `Hist t` -- its common
normalization -- so a `Quotient` by the corresponding `Setoid` would carry
the same information through an extra layer of `Quotient.mk`/`Quotient.lift`
bookkeeping with no descriptive gain; downstream statements about `histDist`,
`totalPayoff`, etc. stay inside the proof-view machinery instead of needing it
re-derived for a fresh quotient type.

## What closes

**Deliverable (1).** `NormalizedHist`, with `normalizeHist` as the retraction
`Hist t → Hist t` onto it and `IsNormalizedHist` as the membership predicate;
`normalizeHist_idem` / `isNormalizedHist_normalizeHist` /
`normalizeHist_eq_self_of_isNormalizedHist` show the three descriptions
(image, fixed points, jointly-legal-throughout) agree.

**Deliverable (2), the mathematical heart.** `normHistStep_eq_of_normalizeHist_eq`:
in the padded game, two raw histories with the same normalization induce the
literally *same* one-stage normalized continuation -- not merely the same
continuation in distribution -- for a profile that cannot read the discarded
labels (`IsNormHistInvariantProfile`). Packaged across a whole trajectory as
`map_normalizeHist_histDist_normalizedGame_succ`: the padded game's history
distribution, pushed forward along `normalizeHist`, satisfies the *same*
one-step recursion as `histDist` itself, so the pushed-forward trajectory is
generated entirely by `normHistStep`, never by `σ`'s behaviour off the
normalized-history diagonal. This is unconditional on the profile in one
respect: `totalPayoff_normalizedGame_normalizeHist_eq` shows the padded
game's payoff bookkeeping already cannot see the raw label, for *any*
profile, since `normStagePayoff` applies `normalizeAct` (idempotently) no
matter what is fed to it.

**Deliverable (3).** `IsNormHistInvariant` / `IsNormHistInvariantProfile` are
the "cannot read the discarded labels" profiles; `isNormHistInvariant_iff`
shows invariance is exactly factoring through `normalizeHist`. This is made
literal at the level of `NormalizedHist` itself: `ofNormHistStrategy` /
`toNormHistStrategy` are mutually inverse
(`isNormHistInvariant_iff_exists_ofNormHistStrategy`) between invariant
strategies and strategies whose domain *is* `NormalizedHist`, so an invariant
strategy is, up to this equivalence, literally a strategy of the
legality-constrained game that was never offered a raw label to begin with.
At the profile level, `isLegalBehaviorProfile_and_isNormHistInvariantProfile_iff`
shows a profile is simultaneously legal and invariant iff it arises by
precomposing *some* legal profile of the original game with the
normalization retraction -- the promised correspondence with profiles of the
legality-constrained game.

## What does not close, and exactly why

Deliverable (4) does **not** close, even under the strengthened hypothesis
that every player of the *prescribed* profile is normalized-history-invariant.
`normalizeAct_eq_of_forall_ne` / `normStagePayoff_eq_of_component_eq` /
`normTransition_eq_of_component_eq` show precisely how far the "raw label is
free" mechanism reaches unconditionally: at a *single* stage, replacing one
player's raw action by any other with the same normalization (holding
everyone else's action fixed) changes neither the padded game's stage payoff
nor its transition -- this is the one-shot content underlying the whole
padding reduction, and it needs no invariance hypothesis at all.

It does not extend to a multi-stage Nash cap. `IsεHorizonNash`/
`IsεLegalHorizonNash` quantify the deviator over *whole* behavior strategies,
which are exactly as unrestricted as the profile `σ` whose projection failed
in `ActionLegalityBehaviorTransfer.lean`. Making the *opponents* invariant
does not fix this: bounding an arbitrary deviator `dev`'s payoff by a legal
one still needs a strategy `dev'` matching `dev`'s payoff, and the natural
candidate -- `dev`'s own output normalized, `dev' t h := (dev t h).map
(normalize1 h.2 who)` -- is evaluated, along *its own* induced trajectory, at
raw histories that are already normalized. Recovering the value `dev` would
have taken at the corresponding raw predecessor is exactly the non-injective
inversion `ActionLegalityBehaviorTransfer.lean` already refutes, and *this*
occurrence of the obstruction is not rescued by opponent invariance, because
it lives entirely inside the deviator's own strategy, not in how opponents
react to it.

The mechanism that could plausibly still close this is not a pointwise
projection at all: the one-shot facts above make a deviator's raw label
*payoff-irrelevant* whenever opponents do not react to it, which suggests
`dev`'s achievable payoff should equal some normalized-history-measurable
strategy's payoff via a **disintegration** argument (condition `dev`'s own
realized action on the *normalized* history reached so far, rather than
project pointwise) instead of a pointwise re-evaluation. The repository
already carries generic conditional-probability infrastructure that such an
argument would presumably build on (`Math.ProbabilityMassFunction.pmfCond`,
`condOn`, `iterCondOn`), but assembling it into an actual equal-payoff
witness, verified inductively across every horizon, is a substantial
undertaking of its own and is not attempted here: this file neither proves
deliverable (4) nor exhibits a separating counterexample refuting it.
Deliverable (4) is left **open**, one precise level deeper than where
The action-legality behavior-transfer obstruction is
located inside the deviator's own strategy specifically, independent of
whatever the opponents do.

/-- **The one-shot content of the padding reduction, made precise at the
joint-action level.** Changing a single player's raw action, while keeping
its normalization fixed and every other player's action fixed, does not
change the normalized joint action at all: `normalizeAct` acts
componentwise (`normalizeAct s a i` depends only on `a i`), so agreement
elsewhere plus agreement of the normalized `who`-component forces agreement
of the whole normalized profile. This is exactly the fact that would make a
raw illegal label "free" if nothing downstream could tell two normalizations
apart -- it needs no invariance hypothesis, and it is exactly as far as the
one-shot mechanism reaches (see the module docstring for why it does not
extend to a multi-stage Nash cap). -/
