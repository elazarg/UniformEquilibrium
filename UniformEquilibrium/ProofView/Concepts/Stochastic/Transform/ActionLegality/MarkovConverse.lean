# The Markov-level converse of action-legality normalization, and its limits

`ActionLegalityNormalization.lean` proves one direction of the padding
correspondence between the legality-constrained stage game and its
state-independent, normalized presentation: a legal Markov profile that is
`ε`-Nash of the *normalized* stage game (`IsεNormalizedMarkovNash`) is `ε`-Nash
of the *legality-constrained* stage game (`IsεLegalMarkovNash`). Its docstring
leaves the converse open, with a specific suspected obstruction: histories
record the *raw* joint action played (`StageRecord = Fin t → State × JointAct`,
`Basic.lean`), so padding normalizes payoffs and transitions but leaves
illegal action labels observable, and distinct illegal actions collapsing onto
the same legal one could stay distinguishable in the history, serving as
costless public signals that enlarge the set of history-dependent equilibria.

## The point

That obstruction cannot be instantiated against `IsεLegalMarkovNash` /
`IsεNormalizedMarkovNash`, the Markov-level notions actually defined in
`ActionLegalityNormalization.lean`, for two independent reasons:

1. `MarkovStrategy` (`StochasticGame.lean`) is `State → Act`: a Markov
   strategy takes no history argument at all, so nothing expressible at this
   level can condition on which action label was played at an earlier stage.
   There is no channel for a signal to be received.
2. Even granting a channel, `normalizeAct` maps *every* illegal action at
   `(s, i)` to the *same* fixed legal fallback `Classical.choose (hLegal s i)`
   — one fallback per `(s, i)`, not one per illegal action. So distinct
   illegal actions are not merely payoff-equivalent to *some* legal action
   pointwise: `normStagePayoff` cannot distinguish them from each other at
   all (`normStagePayoff_update_eq_of_not_legal` below). There is no "which
   illegal action" information for a stage-level comparison to leak in the
   first place.

Consequently the converse is not just unobstructed by the label-leakage
mechanism at this level — it is provable outright, and this file proves it
(`isεNormalizedMarkovNash_of_legal`).

**This does not discharge `LEAN-F0-1`.** The pipeline's blocking concern is
about the behaviour-strategy notion (`IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` /
`IsεHorizonNash` in `Uniform.lean`), built on `BehaviorProfile`/`Hist`
(`Basic.lean`), where strategies *do* take the full history — including raw
played actions — as input, and payoffs *are* aggregated across stages with a
genuine continuation. That is where the label-leakage mechanism could in
principle enlarge the equilibrium set; the positive result here, being
confined to Markov profiles and single-stage comparisons, says nothing about
it. Deciding that question needs a normalized `StochasticGame` built from
`normStagePayoff`/`normTransition` together with a legality-constrained
analogue of `IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff` restricted to legal behavior
profiles — neither of which exists in the repository today — and is a
separate, larger piece of work.

## Main results

* `StochasticGame.normStagePayoff_update_eq_of_not_legal` — no two illegal
  deviations at a state are ever distinguishable to `normStagePayoff`
* `StochasticGame.isεNormalizedMarkovNash_of_legal` — **the Markov-level
  converse**: a legal, `ε`-Legal-Markov-Nash profile is `ε`-Normalized-Markov-
  Nash

/-- **The Markov-level converse of the legality-normalization
correspondence.** A legal Markov profile that is `ε`-Nash of the
legality-constrained stage game is `ε`-Nash of the normalized stage game: a
legal deviation `a'` normalizes to itself, so its normalized payoff is the raw
payoff already covered by legal-Nash; an illegal deviation `a'` normalizes to
the fixed legal fallback `Classical.choose (hLegal s who)` regardless of
which illegal action `a'` is, so its normalized payoff equals the raw payoff
of deviating to that fallback, again already covered by legal-Nash (the
fallback is itself legal). -/
