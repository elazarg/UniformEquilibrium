# Disintegrating a deviator against its own normalized-history marginal

`ActionLegalityNormalizedHistory.lean` localizes the last obstruction to the
padding reduction's unrestricted converse (`LEAN-F0-1`) inside the deviator's
own strategy: an arbitrary deviator `dev` may read raw, discarded labels, and
projecting its output pointwise fails because the projected profile's own
induced trajectory only ever visits already-normalized histories, at which
`dev`'s raw value is unrecoverable. That file names the mechanism that could
still close it -- disintegration: condition `dev`'s *realized* action on the
normalized history reached so far, instead of re-evaluating `dev` at the
wrong (already-normalized) input. This file builds it.

## The construction

Fix a background profile `ρ` (played by every player other than the deviator
`who`) and an arbitrary, unrestricted `dev : G.BehaviorStrategy who`. At time
`t`, `jointDevDist` is the joint law of the raw history reached under
`Function.update ρ who dev` and `dev`'s own realized action there.
`devMarginal` disintegrates this joint law against the normalized history --
using `Math.ProbabilityMassFunction.condOn`, whose own null-mass fallback
(return the law unconditioned) makes this well-defined at *every* normalized
history, including ones the trajectory never reaches. `disintegratedDev`
additionally collapses any residual illegal mass onto a fixed legal fallback
(`legalizeAct`), and `devPrime` lifts the result to a full `BehaviorStrategy`
via `ofNormHistStrategy`, which is automatically label-blind.

## What closes

**Deliverable (1).** `devPrime`, well-defined at every normalized history
including probability-zero ones, with no side condition beyond the section's
finiteness hypotheses (needed for `condOn`'s disintegration identities, not
for the construction itself).

**Deliverable (2).** `isNormHistInvariant_devPrime` (label-blindness, free
from `ofNormHistStrategy`) and `isLegalBehaviorStrategy_devPrime` (legality,
from `legalizeAct`'s range).

**Deliverable (3), for a label-blind *and legal* background profile `ρ`.**
`histDist_devPrime_eq_map_normalizeHist_histDist_dev`: `devPrime`'s own raw
trajectory equals `dev`'s trajectory pushed forward along `normalizeHist`,
proved by induction on the horizon. The inductive step assembles
`Math.ProbabilityMassFunction.bind_pushforward_condOn` (the disintegration
identity for a `condOn`-conditioned bind), `pmfPi_update_bind` (the "Fubini"
step isolating the deviator's own coordinate), and the crux lemma
`pmfPi_update_bind_normOneStage_eq_legalizeAct` (the deviator's raw,
possibly-illegal action is invisible one step later, since the padded game's
transition and the outer `normalizeHist` both renormalize it). Since the
padded game's payoff bookkeeping is already normalization-blind for any
profile (`totalPayoff_normalizedGame_normalizeHist_eq`), the trajectory
equality gives *exact* payoff agreement (`finiteAveragePayoff_devPrime_eq`)
at every horizon and for every player -- strictly more than the "at least"
the row asks for.

**Deliverable (4), conditionally, in two parts.**
`isεLegalHorizonNash_of_isεHorizonNash_normalizedGame` transfers a
label-blind legal `ρ`'s *unrestricted*-deviation padded-game cap to
`G.IsεLegalHorizonNash` -- but, reported honestly, this direction turns out
**not** to need `devPrime` at all: an already-legal deviator's padded- and
original-game payoffs already coincide, so the unrestricted hypothesis
instantiated directly at that deviator suffices. `devPrime` earns its keep in
the second, strictly stronger part:
`finiteAveragePayoff_devPrime_le_of_isεHorizonNash_normalizedGame` shows that
for a **literally arbitrary** (unrestricted, possibly illegal, possibly
raw-label-reading) deviator `dev` -- no restriction on the deviator class
anywhere in the argument -- its *disintegrated, legal* counterpart `devPrime`
is capped in the **original** game's own bookkeeping. This says the padded
game's unrestricted cap is actually achieved by a genuine legal strategy of
`G`, for every unrestricted deviation, not only already-legal ones.
`isLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff_of_witness` assembles both into the
row's target shape: a label-blind, legal, per-accuracy witness of the padded
game's uniform equilibrium payoff yields `G.IsLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff`.

## What does not close, and exactly where

Deliverable (4) as stated in the pipeline is unconditional: an arbitrary
*unrestricted* witness of `(G.normalizedGame ...).IsUniformEquilibriumPayoff`
-- not already known label-blind or legal -- should yield a legal witness of
`G.IsLegalUniformEquilibriumPayoff`. That is **not** established here, and
the reason is localized precisely, one level past where
`ActionLegalityNormalizedHistory.lean` left it.

The inductive argument behind deliverable (3) needs the *background* profile
`ρ` -- every player other than the deviator being disintegrated -- to already
be normalized-history-invariant: `stageActionDist_eq_of_normalizeHist_eq`
supplies the one identity that lets the whole one-stage kernel be rewritten as
a function of the normalized history alone, and it has that invariance
hypothesis on the *whole* profile it is applied to. Disintegrating one
player's strategy while every other coordinate is held at an unrestricted,
possibly non-invariant profile does not repair this: the induction's "the
one-stage kernel depends on the raw history only through its normalization"
step fails exactly at the coordinates that were not disintegrated, since nothing
constrains what they leak about the discarded labels. So obtaining an
invariant-and-legal witness *from an arbitrary unrestricted one* would need
disintegrating *every* coordinate simultaneously against a background that is
itself already invariant -- circular as stated -- confirming, with a precise
technical reason rather than only the non-convexity argument already on
record, that this route is closed: restricting only the prescribed profile
does kill the channel, but the converse must transport an arbitrary
padded-game equilibrium, while invariance transports only invariant ones.
This file does not attempt to route around that; deliverable (4) here is stated
honestly as *conditional* on a label-blind, legal `ρ`, which the row already
flags as a permitted strengthening of the *prescribed* profile only.

## Side conditions

`condOn`'s clean disintegration identities
(`Math.ProbabilityMassFunction.bind_pushforward_condOn`) need `Finite`
carriers. The section accordingly assumes `Finite G.State` and
`Finite (G.Act i)` for every `i`, on top of the ambient `Fintype ι`; these are
not used anywhere in `ActionLegalityNormalizedHistory.lean` and are recorded
here as the side condition this file specifically needs.
