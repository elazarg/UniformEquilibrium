# Action-legality normalization for stochastic games

`StochasticGame.Act` is one action set per player, shared by every state
(see the scope note on that field).  A textbook stochastic game may instead
give each player a *state-dependent* legal action set.  This file carries
out the padding reduction promised in that scope note and repeated in
`UniformExistenceConjecture.lean`: give every player every action at every
state, and let an illegal action carry the payoff and transition of some
fixed legal one, so a `StochasticGame` together with a legality predicate
models the state-dependent presentation without a new game type.

No new game structure is defined.  `Legal` singles out, at each state, the
actions each player is actually allowed to use; the *normalized* stage data
is just `G.stagePayoff`/`G.transition` precomposed with a map that replaces
each illegal action component by a chosen legal one.  The normalized data
agrees with the original on jointly legal action profiles, and a legal
Markov profile that is an ε-Nash equilibrium of the normalized stage game at
every state is an ε-Nash equilibrium of the legality-constrained stage game
(deviations restricted to legal actions).  The converse direction is not
addressed here.

## Main definitions

* `StochasticGame.normalizeAct` — replace illegal action components by a
  chosen legal action
* `StochasticGame.normStagePayoff` / `StochasticGame.normTransition` — the
  normalized stage payoff and transition kernel
* `StochasticGame.IsLegalMarkovProfile` — a Markov profile using only legal
  actions
* `StochasticGame.IsεLegalMarkovNash` — ε-Markov-Nash of the
  legality-constrained stage game (deviations restricted to legal actions)
* `StochasticGame.IsεNormalizedMarkovNash` — ε-Markov-Nash of the normalized
  stage game (deviations range over the full padded action set)

## Main results

* `StochasticGame.normalizeAct_of_jointlyLegal` — normalization is the
  identity on jointly legal action profiles
* `StochasticGame.normStagePayoff_of_jointlyLegal` /
  `StochasticGame.normTransition_of_jointlyLegal` — the normalized stage
  data agrees with the original there
* `StochasticGame.isεLegalMarkovNash_of_normalized` — a legal Markov profile
  that is ε-Nash for the normalized stage game at every state is ε-Nash for
  the legality-constrained stage game
