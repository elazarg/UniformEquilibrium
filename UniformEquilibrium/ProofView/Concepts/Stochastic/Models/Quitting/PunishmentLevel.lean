# Punishment Levels in Quitting Games

Specializes `StochasticGame.punishmentLevel` to the quitting subclass at the
active state.  The clean form proved here is a **ceiling**: a player's
punishment level never exceeds the larger of zero and their own singleton
quitting reward, because opponents who commit to never quitting already
force it.  Under the all-continue opponent profile, the only terminal state
any response can reach is the deviator's own singleton quitter state (this
is `QuittingSimpleBranches.lean`'s exact `Never` test), so the resulting
finite-horizon average is capped at every horizon, with no limiting
argument.

This is a bound "in the right direction" rather than an exact
characterization: computing the punishment level exactly would require
optimizing over every opponent hazard law, not just the all-continue one,
and is out of scope here.

## Main results

* `StochasticGame.finiteAveragePayoff_le_of_forall_expectedStagePayoff_le` —
  a uniform per-stage bound below horizon `T` bounds the finite-horizon
  average (the finite-horizon analogue of
  `StochasticGame.discountedPayoff_le_of_forall_expectedStagePayoff_le`)
* `finiteAveragePayoff_update_quittingAlwaysContinue_le_max` — the finite-`T`
  analogue of `quittingTerminalPayoff_update_quittingAlwaysContinue_le_max`
* `punishmentLevel_quittingGame_le_max` — the punishment-level ceiling

/-- The finite-horizon analogue of
`quittingTerminalPayoff_update_quittingAlwaysContinue_le_max`: at every
finite horizon `T`, not just in the limit, a unilateral deviation from the
all-continue profile pays `who` at most the larger of zero and their own
singleton quitting reward.  Every reachable state under such a deviation is
either still active or the deviator's own singleton terminal state
(`state_eq_none_or_singleton_of_mem_support_update_quittingAlwaysContinue`),
so every one of the `T` stage payoffs already obeys the bound. -/

/-- **Punishment-level ceiling for quitting games.**  At the active state,
player `who`'s punishment level at any horizon `T` is at most the larger of
zero and their own singleton quitting reward: opponents who always continue
already force this ceiling, since `who`'s own singleton state is the only
terminal state reachable under any of `who`'s responses.

The punishment level quantifies over *every* opponent coordination
(`punishmentLevel`'s infimum), not only the all-continue one, so this is a
one-directional bound: the true min-max value could be lower still if some
other opponent hazard law punishes `who` harder. -/
