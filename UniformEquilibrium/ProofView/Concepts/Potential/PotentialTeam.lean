# Team games as potential games

Every team game (identical-interest game) is an exact potential game, with the
potential function being any player's expected utility.

## Main results

- `IsTeamGame.isExactPotential` — a team game is an exact potential game with
  potential `Φ(σ) = eu σ i₀` for any fixed player `i₀`
- `IsTeamGame.nash_iff_local_potential_max` — Nash equilibrium in a team game
  is equivalent to no unilateral deviation improving the potential
- `IsZeroSum.teamGame_utility_zero` — a game that is both zero-sum and team
  must have all utilities identically zero
