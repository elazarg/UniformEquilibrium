# TeamGame

Properties of team games (identical-interest games).

In a team game, all players share the same utility function over outcomes.
This implies that expected utilities are equal across all players under any
strategy profile, and that Nash equilibria have strong non-improvability
properties.

## Main results

- `IsTeamGame.eu_eq` — all players have identical EU under any profile
- `IsTeamGame.eu_eq_update` — EU equality is preserved after unilateral deviations
- `IsTeamGame.nash_deviation_nonimproving` — in a Nash equilibrium of a team game,
  no unilateral deviation improves *any* player's EU (not just the deviator's)

/-- In a team game, if σ is a Nash equilibrium, then for every player `who`,
    every alternative strategy `s'`, and every player `i`,
    the EU at σ is at least as large as after the deviation.

    This is stronger than the Nash condition itself, which only guarantees
    non-improvement for the deviating player. In a team game, because all
    players share utilities, no unilateral deviation can improve *any* player. -/
