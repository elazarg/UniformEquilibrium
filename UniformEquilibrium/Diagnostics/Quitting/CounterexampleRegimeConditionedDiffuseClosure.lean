# Counterexample exclusion on the singleton-tight diffuse boundary

The conditioned diffuse compilers no longer require the optimized source
values to dominate singleton payoffs.  Exact policy and endpoint Nash charge
that possible deficit to the deleted clock.  Consequently a counterexample
seam whose remaining absorption is positive and diffuse cannot converge to
the full singleton boundary.

The result keeps only the two genuine conditioning hypotheses explicit:
eventual absorption is positive at every date, and the normalized one-stage
mesh tends to zero.  Vanishing remaining absorption follows from the seam's
summable joint-absorption clock, while conditioned reward-box boundedness and
singleton individual rationality follow from the canonical seam itself.
