# Support transversality of the compatible tangent blow-up system

After the exceptional-divisor Bellman rows are eliminated, the active
leading-hazard Jacobian is the pair-join matrix

`J i j = r_i({i,j}) - r_i({i})`.

For the positive support of a compatible charge-tangent packet, its positive
mass vector lies in `ker J`.  This projective scale direction has an important
consequence for the ungauged regular-arc interface.  If the radial column is
in `range J`, there is a normalized outward solve, but adding that column
does not make the augmented derivative surjective.  If the augmented
derivative is surjective, the radial column cannot be in `range J`, so no
outward kernel direction exists.  Thus surjectivity and an outward kernel
direction cannot hold simultaneously before projective scale is gauged.

The finite augmented matrix and its full-row-rank criterion are exposed
explicitly.  Failure in the outward branch supplies a nonzero left costate
annihilating both the support Jacobian and the radial column.

For three active coordinates, a substantial solved class is given.  If one
reciprocal pair of directed pair-join effects is nonzero, a single explicit
`3 x 3` radial minor decides the exact alternative: a nonzero minor makes the
augmented system surjective and forbids outward motion; a zero minor has an
explicit outward solve and makes the augmented system singular.  Reindexing
an active support of cardinality three by `Fin 3` applies this criterion
directly.

These are first-derivative statements.  They do not supply the projective
gauge, strict outsider/floor inequalities, or a strategic realization.
