# Regular first-blow-up lifting of charge tangent packets

The raw Nash--Bellman variety is necessarily singular at the all-Continue
root: its active mixing equations lose their rate dependence there.  The
correct regular object is the first radial blow-up

`hazard = t * leading`,

`continuation = boundary + t * drift`.

This module removes the common factor `t` exactly from both equation classes.
The resulting Bellman residual retains every quitting coalition, and the
mixing residual retains every pair and higher opponent coalition.  At the
exceptional divisor `t = 0`, a charge tangent packet solves all Bellman rows
with

`leading = scale * mass`, `drift = -scale * tangent`.

The remaining active equations are the pair compatibilities

`tangent_i + Σ_{j ≠ i} mass_j * (r_i({i,j}) - r_i({j})) = 0`.

On active support this is equivalently the clean pair-join condition

`Σ_{j ≠ i} mass_j * (r_i({i,j}) - r_i({i})) = 0`.

For a declared support, the full finite equality system also sets every
off-support leading coefficient to zero.  It is a polynomial map.  If its
derivative at the packet point is surjective and its kernel contains a
direction with positive radial coordinate, the existing analytic implicit-
function theorem constructs a positive analytic arc.  Strict physical signs
may be carried in an arbitrary open neighborhood.  A separate decoder proves
that every physical zero on this arc is an exact undiscounted Nash--Bellman
root.

This is an abstract regular-lift interface.  For the literal ungauged chart
at a compatible packet, `CounterexampleRegimeTangentSupportTransversality`
proves that the projective scale line is a nonzero radial-zero kernel and
that derivative surjectivity is incompatible with any positive-radial kernel
direction.  A projective gauge or radial-parameter formulation is therefore
needed before this interface can produce an arc.  No lifting, Puiseux
resolution, or arbitrary-player conclusion is asserted here.

/-- **Regular first-blow-up arc lift.**  Pair compatibility places the packet
on the exceptional-divisor equality locus.  If the derivative of that exact
finite polynomial system is surjective and has a kernel direction pointing
outward in the radial coordinate, the repository's analytic implicit-function
theorem constructs an actual positive analytic equality arc.  `U` carries
strict outsider, floor, upper-box, and positivity signs; only signs strict at
the base point may be placed there.

For the literal compatible ungauged chart, the later transversality theorem
shows that the two displayed regularity premises cannot hold together.  This
theorem remains the exact analytic consumer for a future gauged chart; it is
not itself a compatible-packet producer. -/
