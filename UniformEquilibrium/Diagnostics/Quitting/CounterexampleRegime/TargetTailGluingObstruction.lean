# Playerwise punishment tails do not glue to a common repaired suffix

For every positive tolerance, stationary min--max approximation supplies all
finitely many players simultaneously with player-indexed target-closed tails
whose selected endpoints lie within that tolerance above punishment.  This
finite choice does not make the tails compatible.

The obstruction is already exact at the game level.  A positive terminal
exploitability gap lower-bounds the behavioral-tail repair value after every
positive finite prefix.  Consequently, inside a counterexample regime, the
packet's period-one two-owner root admits arbitrarily accurate playerwise
punishment tails while every single common behavioral suffix retains at least
the regime's positive terminal gap.

This also explains why the natural gluing operations do not follow from the
landed hypotheses.  Sequential blocks expose later tails only on survival;
nontrivial product-root randomization can absorb and pays the corresponding
coalition reward; and elementary caps approximate a boundary pair already
co-realized by one tail rather than combining coordinates from different
tails.  A common repair-zero premise, or a construction implying it, remains
necessary.  No return or cycle is asserted here.
