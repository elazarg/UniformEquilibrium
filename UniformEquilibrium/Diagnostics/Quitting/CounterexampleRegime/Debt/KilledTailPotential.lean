# Killed-potential accounting on a counterexample debt tail

This module specializes the scalar killed-potential API to the canonical
optimized exact dynamic-debt tail of a quitting counterexample.  For each
player, joint Continue mass is the survival coefficient, the diagonal debt
seam is the source, and exact dynamic debt is an exact reference potential.

The specialization also isolates the boundary premise needed to compare this
reference with any excessive account having the same source and initial
value.  If the excessive account's surviving terminal boundary dominates the
exact debt boundary, every positively weighted local dissipation in the
window vanishes.  Conversely, one strict positively weighted dissipation
forces the excessive account's boundary strictly below the debt boundary.

The boundary premise is not derived from the terminal exploitability witness.  In
particular, the prescribed value and its dynamic-debt augmented cap do not
have the same initial value: their difference is exactly the (positive, for
the selected owner) dynamic debt.  Thus the results below retain the phantom
boundary explicitly and do not rule out the positive all-Continue plateau.
