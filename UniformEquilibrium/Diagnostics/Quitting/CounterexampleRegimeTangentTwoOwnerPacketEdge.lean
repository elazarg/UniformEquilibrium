# Exact packet edges on the compatible two-owner ray

A compatible charge-tangent packet whose positive-mass support consists of
two owners selects the exact hazard ray

`p_first = t * mass first`,  `p_second = t * mass second`.

For every `0 < t < 1`, both hazards are automatically positive and subunit
and joint survival is positive. Compatibility kills both directed pair-join
effects, so the exact two-owner root module closes the active Bellman and
mixing rows without a second-order construction.

The remaining gates split sharply:

* active continuation is exactly
  `boundary_i - t * tangent_i / (1 - t * mass_j)`; hence a nonnegative
  tangent makes the upper gate automatic when the boundary is in the box,
  while a tight floor and positive tangent fail at every positive scale;
* an inactive owner's gain is the finite forced-Quit regression
  `sigmaValue(t) - boundary`. Strict singleton slack makes this negative for
  all sufficiently small scales. At equality, its pair and higher coalition
  coefficients remain an independent sign test;
* inactive continuation floor/box gates are not consequences of the packet
  equations. They remain explicit in the exact-edge theorem (strict boundary
  slack can be handled by ordinary continuity; tight gates need their own
  finite regression).

The capstone produces one exact Nash--Bellman edge only. It does not construct
a return, lasso, or cycle.
