# A two-owner compatible packet cannot fund the zero terminal target

An interior zero-target lift at an owner with positive singleton payoff must
contain a supported simultaneous-quitting action at which that owner is paid
strictly negatively.  If every active root coordinate lies in a declared
pair, that action is exactly the pair collision.

The tangent compatibility equation on a literal two-owner packet forces the
same pair collision payoff to equal the owner's positive singleton payoff.
Consequently the terminal repair cannot stop on that compatible two-owner
stratum: its physical root support must contain a third owner.  This is a
support-enlargement obstruction, not a construction of the required
three-owner root.  In particular it does not supply the remaining outsider,
floor, or box inequalities.

/-- **Pair support is insufficient for positive terminal funding.**  If a
physical zero-target lift mixes an owner with positive singleton payoff and
the owner's pair-join effect with `other` vanishes, then the lift support
contains a third coordinate outside that pair.

Thus an exact compatible two-owner tangent root cannot also be the required
zero-target incoming root for a positively funded owner. -/

/-- **Compatible packet support must enlarge at the zero target.**  If
`first, second` are the entire positive-mass support of a compatible tangent
packet, then any physical zero-target lift funding `first` positively has an
active third owner outside the packet pair.

The theorem deliberately does not identify that third owner or solve its
three-owner product-root equations. -/
