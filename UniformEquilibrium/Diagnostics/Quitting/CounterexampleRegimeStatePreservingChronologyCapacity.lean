# State-preserving capacity on zero-boundary exact-D chronologies

The unrestricted prefix capacity can approach its supremum at states unrelated
to the positive exact dynamic debt selected by the counterexample regime.  This
file instead takes the supremum over the literal zero-boundary exact-D chains.
Every member of this family retains aggregate initial debt at least the regime's
terminal gap, while prepending an exact Nash--Bellman predecessor remains in the
same family and adds exactly that predecessor root's absorption mass.

Consequently, for every positive tolerance there is one finite chronology which
simultaneously carries positive calibrated debt and admits no exact bounded
predecessor with absorption as large as the tolerance.  Compactness is not used
to assert attainment of the infinite-horizon supremum.  The result is the exact
finite near-maximality statement needed before any projective extraction.

/-- At an all-Continue current state, the exact augmented edge imposes no
condition on the stored root of the successor.  Payoff and debt can stay
fixed while that successor root is chosen arbitrarily.  Thus the root
coordinate is a control for the next edge, not a state coordinate whose
increment is controlled by the current edge's absorption mass. -/
