# A fixed strategic label in the concentrated reprojection branch

The minimum-fiber other-defect alternative can be frozen without losing its
game provenance.  One fixed non-owner player and one fixed Boolean best
endpoint recur on a strict subsequence; the same marked tails and actual roots
converge jointly.  Their limit retains both positive marked-coalition mass and
positive defect in that fixed coordinate.

This also identifies the exact obstruction to the existing reset and cycle
interfaces: the limiting root is quantitatively not an exact Nash root at the
limiting tail.  It therefore cannot be inserted as a cap--Nash reset or an
exact Nash--Bellman cycle row without an additional Nashification step.

/-- **Fixed-label extraction.**  A uniform other-defect sum on a convergent
marked-tail subsequence freezes one non-owner player, its best action, and a
joint root limit.  `charge` is used both as a defect-sum floor and as the root
coalition floor; callers may pass their smaller positive common lower bound. -/
