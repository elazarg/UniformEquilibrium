# Occupation identities on a fixed-owner terminal-semantic spine

On the non-plateau branch of the minimum terminal-semantic chronology, one
fixed owner is the only active player.  The prescribed coordinate therefore
obeys an exact scalar occupation recursion: it is the mixture of the owner's
singleton reward and the next prescribed vector, with weights equal to the
owner's Quit and Continue probabilities.  Iterating gives a finite formula
whose residual coefficient is precisely the owner's survival product.

This identifies the remaining semantic obstruction.  If that survival
product vanishes, boundedness forces the initial prescribed vector to be the
owner's singleton reward vector.  A positive first-stage Continue probability
then propagates the equality to the next state, so the first root is already
an atomic solo endpoint equilibrium.  In a quitting counterexample this is
the isolated-negative branch.  Away from that branch, the survival product
cannot vanish: the semantic chronology necessarily retains a positive
``at infinity'' occupation mass.

Every prescribed state also lies in the finite reward-moment polytope.  Thus
away from atomic closure, the owner-tight slice of that polytope must contain
a vector distinct from the owner's singleton reward.  This is an exact finite
linear obstruction suitable for counterexample search.
