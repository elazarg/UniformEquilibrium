# Value convergence along infinite exact punishment-floor orbits

Inside a quitting counterexample regime, every arbitrary infinite exact
punishment-floor Nash--Bellman orbit has summable absorption mass.  This
module derives the resulting limit geometry of the orbit's Bellman
annotations.

Each one-stage Bellman edge moves a bounded value coordinate by at most
twice the reward bound times the stage's absorption mass.  Summability of
those masses therefore makes every value coordinate a Cauchy sequence, so
the annotations converge coordinatewise to a single payoff vector.

The limit inherits three constraints.  It stays in the canonical compact
reward box.  It dominates the behavioral punishment floor, because every
finite truncation of the orbit is an exact punishment-floor prefix.  And it
dominates every player's own solo quitting reward: at each stage the pure
Quit endpoint is within twice the reward bound times the opponent-absorption
hazard of the solo reward, exact root Nash keeps that endpoint below the
successor annotation, and the opponent hazard vanishes because it is
dominated by the summable joint absorption mass.  The one-shot quit
deviation thus survives to the limit, which is simultaneously individually
rational and solo-undercut-free.

The values here are prescribed Bellman annotations, not realized payoffs of
any strategy profile.  No claim is made that the limit payoff is achieved by
play; identifying annotations with realized continuation payoffs is
precisely the separate realization problem.
