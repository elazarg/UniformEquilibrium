# Flat stopping-law tangent circulation or active-set co-decrease

Zero-excess normalized stopping-law reset directions have coordinate sum
zero.  The finite charged-occupation alternative can therefore be applied to
the full signed debt directions, rather than merely to selected positive
recipient labels.

The dual potential can be shifted by its minimum to become nonnegative,
because constants annihilate every flat column.  If there is no entry into an
inactive debt coordinate, a potential-maximal active debtor cannot have only
nonnegative off-diagonal changes: its charged potential drift would then be
nonpositive.  Thus the dual branch exposes a co-realized decrease of another
active debt coordinate.

This is a finite tangent alternative.  Its circulation branch still requires
an integration theorem before it becomes a chronology or a semantic-state
cycle.

/-- **Dual active-set consumer.**

Let one flat tangent carry strictly positive charge and satisfy the dual
potential inequality.  If its mover maximizes the potential on the active
debt support and every inactive coordinate has zero tangent, then some other
active coordinate strictly decreases.  Otherwise the positive drift would
be bounded by the maximal potential times the zero column sum. -/

variable [DecidableEq ι]

/-- **Support entry, infinitesimal circulation, or same-column co-decrease.**

Assume a finite family of zero-excess stopping-law debt tangents has been
extracted at one common positive semantic point, one for each positive-debt
coordinate.  The mover loses exactly its positive charge, and a coordinate
which is zero at the base cannot have a negative tangent.

Then exactly the obstruction relevant to the active-set pipeline appears:

* some tangent enters a zero-debt coordinate;
* the full signed tangent columns admit a positive charged balance; or
* a nonnegative separating potential exposes one tangent which decreases
  both its potential-maximal mover and another active coordinate.

The circulation is infinitesimal.  No assertion is made that it integrates
to a literal reset cycle or chronology. -/
