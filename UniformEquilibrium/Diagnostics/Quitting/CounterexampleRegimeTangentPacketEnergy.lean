# Energy consequences of an active-positive tangent packet

After the negative-coordinate tangent branch has been excluded, a charge-
tangent packet is canonically a normalized singleton-source packet: its
boundary is the packet target and its tangent is the coordinatewise delivery
surplus.  Thus a positive tangent carried by positive mass makes the existing
singleton packet energy strictly positive.  The energy theorem then supplies
a distinct positive-mass pair with positive reciprocal singleton effect.

This is the complete finite singleton-level handoff, not a product-root
realization.  The Boolean Möbius expansion of a product root also contains
the actual collision rewards, the continuation value, and all pair and higher
coalition coefficients.  Nothing here controls those terms or proves the
on-support equalities and off-support inequalities needed to enlarge support.
In particular, the concrete residue in
`LocalMechanismResidueWitness` shows that reciprocal singleton information
need not produce a two-owner root.  No chronological return, punishment-
admissible cycle, or equilibrium compiler is inferred.
