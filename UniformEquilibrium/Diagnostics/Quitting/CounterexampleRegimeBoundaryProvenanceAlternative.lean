# Boundary provenance and the asymptotic mismatch alternative

The zero-boundary finite minimizers have two complementary compactness
interfaces.  Ordinary projective extraction retains every fixed distance
from the initial state and loses the moving terminal end.  The two-ended
compactification retains a separate reverse ray, but supplies no bridge
survival between the two rays.  A small scalar regression below records why
fixed-coordinate convergence alone cannot recover a moving zero boundary.

The metrizable marked-absorption decoder has the opposite strength: for any
sequence of finite coherent cylinders it jointly retains both exact-D
anchors, holonomy, absorption law, and repair state.  The strengthened
subsequence theorem below exposes the two anchor limits explicitly.  Its
semantic target does not, however, contain the canonical charged-path
capacity potential, so this compactness statement does not compare the
capacity boundary with the exact-D boundary.  Quantitative aggregate
terminal anchors likewise control a terminal packet and a one-sided repair
value; they do not identify the independently selected min--max projective
tail's capacity boundary.

The strongest unconditional conclusion currently available is therefore
asymptotic rather than exact.  The capacity account is antitone, its raw
killed dissipations are summable, and the one-step survival-scaled boundary
mismatch exceeds the initial mismatch by exactly that dissipation.  The
excess tends to zero along the full tail.  Nothing here makes a finite
dissipation vanish, so the zero-face recurrence theorem still needs its
displayed boundary-mismatch nonexpansion premise.
