# Dynamic alternative for the debt-source exposed face

The playerwise debt-source coordinate turns the diagonal dynamic-debt seam
into a literal grade-one price.  Along the canonical optimized tail its
finite and infinite chronological prices are exactly the killed source terms
in dynamic-debt conservation.  This is the correct survival scale: the raw
source tends to zero, but that does not imply that any finite source is zero.

There is nevertheless an exact local alternative.  For a selected player,
either the current tail edge lies in the zero-source exposed face, the next
edge does, or the capacity-derived excessive account has strictly positive
killed dissipation at the current edge.  The last branch is priced exactly
by growth of the survival-scaled boundary mismatch between exact debt and
the capacity account.

Consequently, nonexpansion of that boundary mismatch forces zero-face entry
at the current or next edge, and the same premise at arbitrarily late starts
forces recurrence.  This boundary/return premise is not derived here: the
counterexample seam and the canonical capacity bounds do not compare their
surviving boundaries.  No absorption-normal argument, strategic repair, or
boundary realization is asserted.

positive next source makes the next capacity account positive, so replacing
