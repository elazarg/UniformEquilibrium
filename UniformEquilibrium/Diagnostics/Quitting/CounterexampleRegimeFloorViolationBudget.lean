# Quantitative opponent-clock budget below the punishment floor

Floor-violation amplification contains a quantitative statement stronger than
mere summability.  If the initial violation gap is `delta`, then every finite
suffix clock, and hence the full suffix clock, satisfies the division-free
bound

`delta * opponentClock ≤ punishmentValue + rewardBound`.

The proof is a thin quitting-game adapter around the scalar survival theorem
in `Math.Probability.SurvivalAmplification`: quitting semantics are used only
to produce positive bounded gaps and the one-step amplification inequality.
