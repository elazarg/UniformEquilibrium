# Game-facing refinement of the minimum semantic solo-owner row

The unique-positive-debtor branch of the minimum terminal-semantic stratum
contains a positive-hazard solo-owner row.  This file compares that row with
the genuinely stationary row whose continuation is the owner's singleton
reward vector.

There are only two outcomes.  If the row is still endpoint Nash against the
singleton vector, it is the already classified atomic owner branch: in a
counterexample the owner's singleton payoff is quantitatively negative and
lies strictly below its punishment value.  Otherwise a concrete outsider
blocks stationary closure.  For that outsider the exact affine row lies
strictly above the owner's solo payoff but weakly below the current Continue
endpoint.  Consequently the owner has positive Continue mass and the
outsider's current declared continuation lies strictly above the payoff it
would receive from the owner's solo exit.

This is a finite game-facing alternative.  It does not realize a semantic
carrier point by one behavior profile and does not identify the blocking
outsider with the possibly different outsider whose singleton payoff makes
all-Continue fail.

/-- **Solo-owner closure refinement.**  At a positive minimum semantic-debt
coordinate, either all-Continue is an exact semantic self-loop, or there is
a unique positive-debt owner and an attractive-singleton outsider.  In the
latter branch, the selected solo row either closes at the owner's singleton
vector, landing in the quantitative isolated-negative branch, or a second
(possibly equal) outsider witnesses the exact affine failure of that closure.
