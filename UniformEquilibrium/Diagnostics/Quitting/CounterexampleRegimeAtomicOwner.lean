# The atomic owner-monopoly branch is the isolated-negative branch

Suppose a positive-rate solo row owned by `owner` is exact endpoint Nash
against the owner's singleton payoff vector.  The inactive coordinates then
have no stationary joining gain.  In a quitting counterexample the terminal
gap must therefore be witnessed by the owner's deviation to Never.  This
quantitatively forces

`r_owner({owner}) <= -terminalGap`.

The same row is a self-consistent absorbing period-one Nash--Bellman block.
Because every opponent is silent, its negative owner is precisely the
isolated-negative branch of the cyclic classification.  Thus an atomic
owner-monopoly limit is not a new fourth obstruction: it lands in the
existing isolated-negative branch, with its entire terminal gap carried by
the owner's Never deviation.

Punishment completion then supplies the decisive extra restriction.  If the
owner's behavioral punishment value is no larger than its singleton payoff,
the isolated cycle is itself uniformly enforceable.  Hence a counterexample
atomic owner must have punishment value *strictly above* its negative
singleton payoff.  In particular the coordinatewise punishment-tight
singleton stratum excludes the atomic owner-monopoly branch completely.

This does not justify deleting the owner: after deletion, the owner may still
join an absorbing coalition, and that terminal deviation cannot be punished
after the fact.
