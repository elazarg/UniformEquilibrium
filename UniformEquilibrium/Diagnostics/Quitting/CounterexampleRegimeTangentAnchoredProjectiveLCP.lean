# Tangent packets as anchored projective LCP packets

A charge-normalized tangent packet already has the exact affine identity
needed by the repository's anchored projective singleton LCP.  For any
cemetery weight `c ∈ (0, 1]`, assign singleton weight
`(1 - c) * mass owner`, retain `boundary` as the value, and use the anchor

`boundary - ((1 - c) / c) * tangent`.

The tangent identity makes the anchored mixture equation exact.  On an
active owner, the anchored LCP direction is the negative rescaled tangent;
in particular an active positive tangent gives a strictly negative direction
for `c < 1`.

This is an algebraic bridge into the existing projective LCP coordinates.  It
does not construct a simultaneous quit-rate root, a resolved projective chart,
or the real/Puiseux arc required by `QuittingResolvedProjectiveChartInterface`.
Collision and higher-coalition terms belong to that unresolved lifting step,
not to the singleton first-event identity proved here.
