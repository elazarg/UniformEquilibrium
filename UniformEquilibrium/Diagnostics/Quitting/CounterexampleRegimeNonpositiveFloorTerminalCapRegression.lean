# Nonpositive punishment does not erase the zero-boundary terminal cap

The terminal state in the intrinsic finite-chain carry telescope has exact
aggregate debt

`sum_i max(0, r_i({i}))`.

It is tempting to expect a coordinatewise nonpositive behavioral punishment
vector to make this terminal debt vanish.  The existing two-player terminal
packet regression disproves that implication.  Both players can be punished
to a nonpositive value by explicit stationary opponent rows, while player
one's positive-singleton terminal cap is exactly one.

This finite regression does not instantiate a counterexample regime and does
not compute its global admissible charge capacity.  Its role is narrower: it
shows that the automatic zero-cap closure of the terminal carry gate is a
strict subclass of `punishmentValue ≤ 0`; a quantitative incoming-path or
same-state capacity premise is still genuinely required.
