# First-order active-mixing compatibility of a tangent packet

For the first-order ansatz with quit hazards `x = t * a` and continuation
value `boundary + t * u`, the active mixing row for receiver `who` contains

`tangent who + sum_{owner != who} mass owner *
  (r_who({who, owner}) - r_who({owner}))`.

On positive mass, packet pinning turns the tangent into the singleton
solo-effect average.  The displayed row therefore collapses exactly to the
mass-weighted pair-join effect

`sum_{owner != who} mass owner *
  (r_who({who, owner}) - r_who({who}))`.

Thus the singleton packet identities do not make the first-order mixing rows
vanish.  If they do vanish, singleton energy must instead be cancelled by the
collision-increment energy.  Under an active positive tangent this forces a
negative reciprocal collision-increment pair.  If a row does not vanish, a
supported directed pair has the same strict sign, and the canonical finite
sign functional strictly separates the active residual vector from zero.

All results here are finite algebraic identities.  They neither construct a
product-root arc nor assert that the separating functional satisfies the
additional annihilation and sign conditions of a strategic Farkas
certificate.
