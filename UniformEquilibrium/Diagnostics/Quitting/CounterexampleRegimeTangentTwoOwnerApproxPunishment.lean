# Approximate punishment attachment at a tight two-owner boundary

An active positive-tangent owner at
`boundary = quittingPunishmentValue` blocks the exact two-owner ray because
its continuation lies below the exact punishment floor. Uniform equilibrium,
however, is approximate. The deficit is

`t * tangent first / (1 - t * mass second)`,

which tends to zero with the hazard scale. Consequently every prescribed
positive rationality error absorbs the deficit at all sufficiently small
positive scales. The stationary min--max approximation theorem then supplies
a player-specific target-closed punishment tail whose terminal value is within
the rationality error and an arbitrary positive tail slack of the exact-ray
continuation.

This is the honest approximate consumer of the tight floor. It remains
scale- and tolerance-dependent:

* the punishment row/tail may vary with the scale and requested accuracy;
* the construction is target-specific, not one common suffix for all players;
* no full behavior profile, return edge, lasso, or solved cycle is produced.

The first theorem isolates the obstruction to stronger uniformity. A single
stationary row satisfying the punishment cap at every positive accuracy would
actually attain the punishment infimum, and general quitting min--max theory
does not provide such attainment.
