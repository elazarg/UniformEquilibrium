# Uniform equilibrium as bounded excess work

Uniform equilibrium can be expressed as a bounded-work condition.  Fix a
candidate target `v` and a positive linear penalty `η`.  A profile has bounded
work when one common constant `B` bounds, at every horizon,

* every deviator's cumulative payoff above `v + η`; and
* prescribed play's cumulative deficit below `v - η`.

The work is written as `T` times a finite-average excess.  This avoids adding a
second total-payoff API while keeping the intended interpretation exact.

The main theorem proves that a payoff vector is a uniform-equilibrium payoff if
and only if it has bounded-work certificates at every positive penalty.  The
forward direction uses uniformity for late horizons and the finite stage-payoff
bound for the finitely many early horizons.  The reverse direction divides the
fixed work budget by a sufficiently long horizon.

This is the semantic available-storage theorem.  It guarantees a root-level
bounded account but does not assert that the account has finite memory,
continuity, semialgebraicity, or a public implementation.

/-- A positive work obstruction for target `v`.

One linear penalty defeats every profile and every proposed finite budget:
at some horizon either a unilateral behavior deviation exceeds the budget or
prescribed play accumulates more than that budget of target deficit. -/
