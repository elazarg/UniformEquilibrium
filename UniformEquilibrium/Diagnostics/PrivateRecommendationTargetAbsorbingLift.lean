# Diagnostic one-decision absorbing lift of the private-recommendation separator

This file realizes the strategic-form matrix in
`PrivateRecommendationTargetSeparator.lean` as a four-state stochastic game.
The decision state moves immediately to one of three absorbing states.  The
expected absorbing payoff, conditional on every pure first action, is
exactly that action's strategic-form payoff.

More strongly, after fixing the action at every visit to the decision state,
the expected average payoff equals the same strategic-form payoff at every
positive finite horizon.  The behavior profile away from the decision state is
arbitrary, so history and memory after absorption cannot change this identity.

This is a payoff-preserving stochastic lift only.  It defines no private
recommendation device, proves no autonomous correlated equilibrium, and proves
no compiler or noncompiler theorem.
