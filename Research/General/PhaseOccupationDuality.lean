# Phase-augmented occupation measures: a duality prototype

This experiment isolates the finite linear part missing from
`Math.Probability.SwitchedPotentialCalculus`.  A phase occupation is a
nonnegative, normalized mass on `(phase, state, action)`.  Its flow law says
that advancing the phase and applying the selected transition kernel leaves
the state marginal unchanged.  We use its (equivalent, in finite dimension)
test-function form, because it is exactly the form which pairs with a bias.

The main result, `phaseAverageReward_le_bias`, is weak LP duality: the reward
of every feasible phase occupation is upper-bounded by every feasible
bias/slack value. Thus a bias with slack `g` caps the reward of every invariant
phase occupation by `g`.

The deliberately absent part is *strong* duality.  The imported finite LP
duality API is sufficient in principle, but connecting its matrix encoding to
the present `PMF` notation requires a separate, fairly mechanical matrix
compiler (including equality rows represented in both directions).  This file
keeps the semantic objects and the weak-duality theorem small enough to be
useful as that compiler's specification.
