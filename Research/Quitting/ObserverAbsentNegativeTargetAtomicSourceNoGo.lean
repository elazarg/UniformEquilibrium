# A forced-owner atomic barrier does not return to the actual source row

The observer-absent and negative-target leaves both reach the atomic
blocker barrier, but at different rows.  In the negative-target leaf the
sure quitter is part of the actual source profile.  In the observer-absent
leaf the sure quitter was installed counterfactually, and the outsider edge
must still be transported back across the owner square.

The two-player square below is a sharp regression for identifying those two
objects.  The counterfactual forced-Quit row has a positive outsider defect,
the selected outsider action has positive support, and the associated
forced-Continue-face loss is positive.  Nevertheless the actual source root
is exact endpoint Nash and both pure source actions have zero gain.

Neither positive global-minimum provenance nor the counterexample terminal
gap can be added to this local witness: either addition would already imply
nonexistence of a uniform-equilibrium payoff, contradicting the unconditional
two-player theorem.  Thus those global hypotheses do not provide an
independent source-row transport principle.  A genuine merger of the two
leaves needs a new signed square identity that returns the forced-row edge to
the carrier; the shared atomic barrier alone is insufficient.
