# Debt transport is stationary Markov monodromy

A closed word of nonnegative debt transports is naturally a Markov kernel on
the time-expanded player set.  The debt vector is a stationary, generally
non-full-support weight.  The full-support hypothesis in the standard return
theorem is stronger than this application needs: nonnegativity everywhere
and positivity at the source of the selected edge suffice.

Thus every positive debt-transfer edge lies on a recurrent support cycle.
The resulting object is a Markov/transportation-polytope object, not a group
in general.  A permutation or group orbit appears only after a deterministic
extremalization which is not asserted here.

/-- **A positive stationary edge returns without full support.**

For a finite Markov kernel with a nonnegative stationary weight, a support
edge whose source has positive weight can be followed by a support path back
to that source.  Zero-weight states elsewhere are harmless. -/
