# A four-player cyclic plateau candidate

This is a bounded search object, not a counterexample to uniform-equilibrium
existence.  Four pure sure-exit profiles run around one Boolean square.  Two
players alternate as strict best-response movers, a permanent host carries a
second unit of debt at every phase, and an observer is passive.  Total debt is
therefore exactly two throughout the literal unilateral reset cycle.

At every phase, the behavioral cap is the same vector `(1,1,0,0)`.  The host
and observer strictly Continue at every product root.  Once they Continue,
both movers strictly Continue as well, so all-Continue is the unique exact
cap--Nash root.  In particular, none of the four cycling pure roots is itself
an exact cap--Nash operation.

All singleton rewards are nonpositive, hence every punishment value is
nonpositive.  The experiment deliberately claims only a positive floor on
its displayed finite four-profile family.  It makes no positive-minimum claim
about the full terminal-semantic carrier.

The sharp global fence is explicit: the literal all-Continue profile is an
exact terminal Nash equilibrium and its terminal semantic pair has zero debt.
Thus this file is a negative search control.  It isolates both failures of
the tempting cyclic construction: exact cap/state admissibility and a
positive global semantic floor.  Debt circulation by itself is compatible
with neither missing property.
