# Positive-part action of survival-weighted blocks

A survival-weighted block acts on a nonnegative scalar resource by transporting
the resource through survival, subtracting the selected raw charge, and
truncating at zero:

```text
block • debt = max 0 (block.survival * debt - block.charge[channel]).
```

Chronological block concatenation acts by function composition.  The exact
accounting identity separates loss of future reach from immediate charge
consumption.  This module is independent of games; literal terminal-debt
prefixing is one client of the action.
