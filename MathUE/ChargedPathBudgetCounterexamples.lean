# Sharpness of the path-budget / bounded-potential duality

Three explicit charged relations delimiting `Math.ChargedPathBudget`.

## Towers

`Towers.relation` is a countable charged relation whose `k`-th component is a
finite chain of `k` unit-charge edges.  Every finite path has finite charge, every
path has length at most its component index (so there is no infinite path at all),
and from each state the reachable charges are bounded.  The budget is nevertheless
infinite, so no bounded potential exists.  Pointwise finiteness of the budget-to-go
is therefore strictly weaker than a uniform budget.

## Continuous incompleteness

`Interpolation.relation` is a charged relation on the plane whose edges all live in
the compact unit square.  Its budget is exactly one, witnessed by an exact bounded
potential; but every potential for it — bounded or not — fails to be continuous at
the origin.  So exact potentials cannot in general be chosen continuous, even for a
relation supported on a compact set and of small budget.

## Quit-bonus calibration

`QuitBonus` is an arithmetic calibration for two-player quitting-style value
updates.  For the table `w {1} = (a, 0)`, `w {2} = (1, -1)`, `w {1,2} = (0, 1)`,
the value vector `v = (a, 0)` and the row `x = (1/2, 0)` (the first player quits
with probability one half, the second continues surely), the one-stage update fixes
`v` exactly, with continuation mass `1/2` and hence quitting charge `1/2 > 0`.  This
is an exact positive-charge self-loop, so the corresponding charged relation admits
no bounded potential of any kind.
