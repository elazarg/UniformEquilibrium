# The normalized singleton LCP

For a finite index type `ι` and a matrix `B : ι → ι → ℝ`, the **normalized
singleton linear complementarity problem** asks for `λ ∈ Δ(ι)` (the standard
simplex, `stdSimplex ℝ ι`) whose image `q = Bλ` is componentwise nonnegative
and complementary to `λ`: `λ i * q i = 0` at every coordinate.

This is the finite structure behind the "singleton" comparison matrices that
appear throughout the quitting-game reduction: for a coalition reward
`r : {S : Finset ι // S.Nonempty} → (ι → ℝ)`, the matrix
`Bᵢⱼ = r({j})ᵢ - r({i})ᵢ` compares player `i`'s payoff at `j`'s solo
termination against its own. Feasibility of this LCP is what several
recorded results (the absorption-vanishing equivalence, in particular) turn
on.

## Main definitions

* `singletonLCPResidual B λ` — the residual vector `q = Bλ` at a simplex point
* `SingletonLCPFeasible B` — the feasibility predicate itself
* `quittingSingletonMatrix reward` — the game-facing comparison matrix
* `quittingSingletonLCPFeasible reward` — the LCP instantiated at a quitting
  reward

## Main results

* `singletonLCPFeasible_iff_exists_supportPattern` — the support-pattern
  reduction: feasibility iff some nonempty `S` carries a simplex point
  vanishing off `S`, with residual zero on `S` and nonnegative off it. This
  is the finite alternative every downstream check uses.
* `singletonLCPFeasible_bool_iff` — the two-coordinate case, worked out as an
  explicit three-way disjunction of sign/algebraic conditions on the four
  matrix entries.
* `quittingSingletonLCPFeasible_iff` — the unfolding lemma bridging the
  game-facing predicate to the raw LCP.

## Design notes

`Math.LinearProgramming` is otherwise independent of `GameTheory`; this file
is the one place that bridges the two, since deliverable (3) of `LEAN-P1-5`
is explicitly the game-facing instantiation. The bridge is one-directional
(only `GameTheory.Basic`, the lightweight `Payoff` abbreviation, is needed)
and does not create an import cycle.

/-! ## The support-pattern reduction

`SingletonLCPFeasible` is a single Prop over a real-valued witness `λ`, but
the complementarity condition forces its zero/nonzero pattern into a finite
alternative: `λ`'s support `S` is where the residual vanishes, and everywhere
else the residual only needs to stay nonnegative. This is the structure every
downstream finite check (in particular decidability, deliverable (4)) uses. -/

/-- **Support-pattern reduction.** `B` is singleton-LCP feasible iff there is
a nonempty coalition `S` and a simplex point `λ` supported on `S`
(`λ i = 0` off `S`) whose residual vanishes on `S` and stays nonnegative off
it. Given feasibility, `S` may be taken to be the exact support of the
witness `λ`; conversely, complementarity for any such `(S, λ)` pair is
automatic, since off `S` the factor `λ i` vanishes and on `S` the factor
`(Bλ) i` vanishes. -/

/-! ## Game-facing instantiation

For a quitting weight assigning a payoff to every nonempty coalition (the
reward type used throughout, e.g. `QuittingZeroSoloDisjunct.lean`), the
singleton comparison matrix `Bᵢⱼ = r({j})ᵢ - r({i})ᵢ` measures player `i`'s
incentive to let `j` solo-terminate rather than solo-terminating itself.
Feasibility of its singleton LCP is the criterion the absorption-vanishing
equivalence of the pipeline record `exact-vs-relaxed` turns on. -/

is player `i`'s payoff when `j` solo-terminates minus player `i`'s payoff
