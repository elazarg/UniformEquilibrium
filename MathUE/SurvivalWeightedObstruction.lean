# Survival-weighted raw obstructions

This file provides a small generic algebra for nonnegative raw charges carried
by killed or absorbing blocks.

A raw charge is a nonnegative real vector.  A block pairs such a charge with a
survival factor in `[0,1]`.  Chronological concatenation is

```text
survival(x ++ y) = survival(x) * survival(y),
charge(x ++ y)   = charge(x) + survival(x) • charge(y).
```

Thus raw charges have survival grade one.  The construction is associative and
has the zero-charge, unit-survival block as an identity.

An annotated block additionally carries entry and exit values.  For compatible
blocks, endpoint displacement is an ordinary coboundary:

```text
displacement(x ++ y) = displacement(x) + displacement(y).
```

It therefore has grade zero, not grade one.  If
`A = 1 - survival` and `ξ = displacement / A`, then concatenation satisfies

```text
A(x ++ y) = A(x) + survival(x) * A(y),
A(x ++ y) * ξ(x ++ y) = A(x) * ξ(x) + A(y) * ξ(y).
```

The missing survival factor in the second occurrence of `A(y)` is deliberate:
the tangent numerator is a coboundary, whereas the absorption clock is a killed
charge.  This grading distinction is the durable content of the tangent
calculation.

The module is intentionally independent of games, probability distributions,
compactness, and strategic realizability.  Clients choose the charge-channel
type and supply any domain-specific adapters separately.
