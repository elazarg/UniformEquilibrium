# Selection of divergent charged paths

This module separates two properties of a nonnegatively charged relation.
Finite paths from a state may have arbitrarily large charge, while no single
infinite path need accumulate unbounded charge.  The missing compatibility is
expressed by `ChargeRenewal`: after collecting one unit of charge, one can end
at a state from which finite charge is still unbounded.

Infinite paths are represented in nonempty finite blocks.  Each block is a
literal `ChargedRelation.Path`, so no edge or charge is omitted, and
`prefixPath` flattens every finite block prefix back to one ordinary finite
path.  This representation makes concatenation and renewal choice exact while
avoiding an irrelevant encoding of a stream position inside a variable-length
block.

The main theorem states, for arbitrary charged relations, that charge renewal
is equivalent to the implication from unbounded finite charge to existence of
one divergent infinite path.  No compactness, finite branching, or application
to game theory is asserted.
