# Compact finite charged return

Compactness turns the finite labelled charged-return theorem into a metric
statement with exactly the quantifiers supplied by finite-prefix orbit
producers.

For a requested return radius `r > 0`, take a finite `r / 3`-cover with `m`
centres and require total charge at least `2m`.  Labelling each state by one
cover centre and applying `exists_same_label_with_large_charge_gap` produces
two ordered states at distance less than `r`, separated by charge at least
one.

The finite path may depend on the requested charge threshold.  No diagonal
extraction and no single orbit working for every charge target are required.

/-- **Compact charged-return threshold.**

For every positive metric radius there is a finite charge threshold such that
any sequence in the compact set whose prefix reaches that threshold contains
a close ordered return carrying raw charge at least one. -/

/-- **Arbitrarily charged finite prefixes already force a returned block.**

This is the quantifier form used by finite-prefix orbit producers.  The orbit
may depend on the requested charge target.  Compactness first chooses one
finite target from the metric radius, and the producer is invoked only at that
target. -/
