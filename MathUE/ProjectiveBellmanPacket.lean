# Projective first-event Bellman packets

A discounted one-state Bellman equation has the scalar form

`v = (1 - ε) * (a + c * v)`.

Here `ε` is the discount-complement (the probability of an artificial
cemetery event), `c` is the probability of surviving the physical stage, and
`q = 1 - c` is the real absorption probability.  The first-event
denominator is

`D = ε + (1 - ε) * q = 1 - (1 - ε) * c`.

Normalizing by `D` gives two nonnegative projective weights

`ω₀ = ε / D`, `ω₁ = (1 - ε) * q / D`,

whose sum is one.  The Bellman equation becomes

`D * v = (1 - ε) * a`.

When `q > 0`, this is equivalently

`v = ω₁ * (a / q)`:

`a / q` is the payoff conditional on a real absorption event and `ω₀` is the
cemetery mass.  Keeping `ω₀` is the load-bearing compactification step in the
matching discount/absorption regime.
