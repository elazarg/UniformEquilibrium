# Fixed analytic maximizers for finite certificate rays

This file joins two independent reductions:

* a finite ray family attains the supremum of every positive-mass
  certificate ratio;
* a finite family of analytic value germs has one fixed eventual maximizer.

The theorem deliberately assumes that a common finite ray index already
parametrizes the certificate cone on a right neighborhood.  Producing such a
family from a parameter-dependent matrix is the basic-feasible-solution
stabilization step.

/-- If a parameter-dependent certificate cone has a common finite ray
decomposition and the ray ratios are analytic germs, then one fixed ray
attains the certificate-ratio supremum throughout a right neighborhood.

The strict positive-mass hypothesis excludes candidates which cease to be
normalized feasible rays.  In the Farkas application the candidates have
mass exactly one. -/
