# Regression examples for charged-path selection

This module records four exact boundary tests:

* a serial one-step tower has unbounded finite charge at its root, while each
  infinite path chooses one finite charge and then accumulates zero;
* an arbitrarily long zero-charge delay may precede a positive recurrent loop;
* a locally greedy charged edge may enter a zero-charge trap, while a zero-charge
  first edge reaches a divergent recurrent state;
* the maximizing first branch may switch between horizons one and three.

The one-step tower is countable and no compact structure is asserted; it is not
a substitute for a compact metastability example.  Together the examples fence
the scope of `ChargeRenewal`, delayed selection, local greediness, and
finite-horizon maximization.
