# Finite charged return

An infinite nonsummable orbit is not needed to obtain a charged compact
return.  Suppose a finite path is labelled by one of `m` cells, and its
nondecreasing prefix clock moves by at most one per step.  If the clock gains
at least `2m`, then two ordered times have the same label and are separated by
clock gain at least one.

The proof samples the first hitting times of the levels

`clock 0 + 2j`, `j = 0, ..., m`.

There are `m + 1` samples and only `m` labels.  A repeated label at ranks
`j < k` gives clock gap at least one: the later sample is at or above level
`2k`, while minimality and the unit step bound put the earlier sample strictly
below level `2j + 1`.

This is the finite quantifier form needed by projective-lasso closing.  For a
fixed metric tolerance, choose a finite cover of the compact value box and ask
the orbit producer for one prefix with charge at least twice the number of
cover cells.  No single orbit has to work for every charge target.
