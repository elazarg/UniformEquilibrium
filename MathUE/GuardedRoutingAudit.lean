# Guarded routing audit: the abstract skeleton

Provenance: this file is the game-free skeleton of the guarded-routing audit,
whose full statement is recorded in an untracked local research note.  It formalizes
only the bookkeeping layer of that audit -- the part which is genuinely
independent of the analytic atlas -- over an arbitrary node type.  It is
deliberately *not* the full guarded registry (refined obstruction cells, the
coverage formulas, the status-refined neutral graph and its phase map); that
full registry is future work gated on the rank re-review.

The abstract package is a `LocalRuleSystem`: a well-founded rank codomain, a
rank assignment, and a local rule sending each node to `closed`, an explicit
finite child list, or a typed obstruction.

Two hypotheses are stated *on* such a system rather than bundled into it:

* `StrictProgress` -- every emitted child strictly decreases the rank;
* `ObstructionFree` -- no node reachable from the root emits an obstruction.

Both must remain assumable *and refutable*, so neither is a structure field
carrying its own proof.  Under them, `auditCertificate_of_strictProgress_of_`
`obstructionFree` produces an `AuditCertificate`: the reachable unfolding is a
finite set of nodes and every reachable leaf is closed.  This is Koenig-style
bookkeeping, not game mathematics: the strategic content — the eight-gate
child verifier, minimal strategic closure, guard coverage — lives
entirely in *establishing* `StrictProgress` for a concrete system, not here.

## The self-child falsifier

The self-child falsifier exhibits the one-state, one-action, zero-payoff game
whose single local rule returns the singleton child list `[N]`.  Every child-validity
field passes and the rank codomain is well founded, yet the recursion is the
infinite self-chain `N ⇝ N ⇝ N ⇝ ⋯`.  `selfChildSystem` is that example, and
`not_strictProgress_selfChildSystem` machine-checks its lesson: a well-founded
rank *codomain* together with well-typed child data does **not** imply progress.
`not_wellFounded_childRel_selfChildSystem` and `selfChildSystem_infinite_branch`
sharpen this -- the child relation itself is not well founded and an infinite
branch exists -- while `selfChildSystem_obstructionFree` shows the failure is
not caused by a missing obstruction consumer.  The strict-descent hypothesis is
where all the content sits.

Note on scope: the falsifier refutes the *hypothesis*, not the conclusion.  Its
reachable node set is a singleton and hence finite; what fails is the branch
well-foundedness that `StrictProgress` supplies in general (`not_infinite_branch`).

`closedSystem` is the vacuity probe: the all-closed system satisfies both
hypotheses, so the interface is inhabited and the positive theorem is not empty.
