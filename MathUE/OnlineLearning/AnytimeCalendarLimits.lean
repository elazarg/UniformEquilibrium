# Limits of the anytime logarithmic calendar

The epoch containing a calendar time tends to infinity, so the universal
scale read at every calendar time — not only at epoch indices — tends to
zero while staying positive.  Consequently any implementation cost vanishing
with the analytic parameter has vanishing calendar average, including over
unfinished epochs.
