# Normalized mixed compatibility alternative

Suppose every player's subsystem of a finite family of weak linear
inequalities is feasible.  Then exactly one of the following positive
outcomes is available:

* the whole coupled system is feasible;
* there is a normalized nonnegative Farkas balance with strictly positive
  certificate value whose player-constraint support contains constraints
  owned by two distinct players.

The normalization uses only multiplier mass on player constraints.  Common
facet multipliers are not counted.  The second branch is therefore a
concrete genuinely mixed obstruction, not merely an arbitrary infeasibility
proof.

This theorem does not turn the obstruction into a continuation witness,
rank descent, or a discharged account.  It identifies the exact finite
mixed-player leaf that remains when separate player feasibility does not
glue.
