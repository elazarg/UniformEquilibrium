# Owner-labeled flow systems and the zero-holonomy gluing condition

**Provenance.**  This is the "Layer A" routing interface for strategic
routing under a full-support mixed-context certificate: the typed incidence
and circulation notation, the two-row account obstruction, and the global
gluing invariant.  It is consumed later by the mixed-owner routing no-go,
which needs the gluing condition `ZeroHolonomy` as a *separate* hypothesis
rather than as a consequence of ownerwise Bellman provenance.

**This file is deliberately game-free.**  Everything below is finite
linear algebra over `ℝ`: no games, no strategies, no payoffs, no
probability measures, no dynamics.  Rows `R` and vertices `V` are bare
finite types, `P` is a bare row-stochastic matrix, and `ownerOf` is a bare
map into a label type.  The game-theoretic reading (rows = tagged Bellman
rows, `src` = public source configuration, `P` = lifted transition law,
`c` = row-charge cochain, `ownerOf` = owning player) belongs to the
consumers of this interface, not here.

## Main definitions

* `incidence src P x`: the incidence operator `B`,
  `(B x)(v) = ∑_{src r = v} x r - ∑_r x r * P r v`.
* `IsCirculation` / `IsNormalizedCirculation`: a nonnegative flow balanced
  at every vertex, resp. one whose total row mass is also normalized to `1`.
* `IsOwnerPure ownerOf i x`: the flow `x` is supported on owner `i`'s rows.
* `holonomy c x`: the account pairing `∑_r x r * c r`.
* `ZeroHolonomy src P c`: the gluing condition — every circulation pairs
  nonpositively with the charge cochain `c`.
* `IsAccountPotential src P c H`: the pointwise
  superharmonicity `c r + ∑_v P r v * H v - H (src r) ≤ 0`.

## Main results

* `zeroHolonomy_iff_exists_accountPotential`: the Farkas duality between the
  gluing condition and existence of an account potential.  Zero holonomy
  holds exactly when a single scalar account potential discharges every row
  charge.
* `TwoCycle.not_zeroHolonomy` together with
  `TwoCycle.ownerPure_circulation_eq_zero`: the abstract skeleton of the
  owner-switching falsifier.  On the two-row two-vertex owner-switching
  cycle every owner-pure circulation vanishes (so each owner is separately harmless)
  while the mixed uniform circulation has holonomy `(α₁ + α₂) / 2 > 0`.
  Owner-pure harmlessness therefore does **not** imply zero holonomy.

/-! ### The two-row owner-switching falsifier

The abstract skeleton: two vertices `false`,
`true`; two rows, row `b` sourced at `b` and moving deterministically to
`!b`; the two rows are owned by two different owners, and carry charges
`α₁`, `α₂` with `α₁ + α₂ > 0`.

The uniform occupation `(1/2, 1/2)` is a normalized circulation with
holonomy `(α₁ + α₂) / 2 > 0`, so the gluing condition fails and (by the
main theorem) no account potential exists.  Yet
every owner-pure circulation is identically zero (every one-owner
subsystem is harmless).  Owner-pure harmlessness therefore does not imply
zero holonomy. -/
