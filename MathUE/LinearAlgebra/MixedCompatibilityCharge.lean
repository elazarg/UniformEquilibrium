# Extracting a player-owned charge from a coupled Farkas balance

A genuinely mixed Farkas balance need not decompose into playerwise
balances.  It nevertheless has a direct constructive use.  At every point
satisfying the common constraints, its weighted certificate value is no
larger than the weighted sum of the player-constraint deficits.

After normalizing the total player multiplier mass to one, one fixed
player-constraint deficit is therefore at least the full certificate value.
In a Bellman system this constraint names an actual player and an actual
forward deviation; no formal reversal or mixed-owner stochastic flow is
needed.

This result does not assert simultaneous continuation compatibility and it
does not force the continuation point onto a proper face.  It supplies the
response branch when compatibility fails.

/-- **Mixed-circuit response extraction.**

Normalize the total multiplier mass on player constraints to one.  At every
candidate continuation satisfying the common facets, some actual
player-owned constraint has deficit at least the complete coupled
certificate value.  In particular, a positive mixed obstruction produces a
positive forward response rather than a mixed-owner occupation flow. -/
