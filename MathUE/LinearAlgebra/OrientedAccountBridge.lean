# Oriented account bridges: the exact common-bridge core

**Provenance.**  This is the finite linear-algebra core of an owner-history
account-obstruction analysis, built on the holonomy substrate of
`Math.LinearAlgebra.OwnerLabeledFlowHolonomy`.  It formalizes three pieces of
that analysis:

* the drift operator `D` and the signed public cycle space of its "Common
  notation" — here `D` is the negated coboundary
  `H ↦ (r ↦ H (src r) - ∑ v, P r v * H v)` already available through
  `OwnerLabeledFlowHolonomy.sum_incidenceEntry_mul`, and the cycle space is
  the kernel of `incidence`;
* Part B (orientation completion): a charge may admit a ledger for one
  orientation and not the other, so "both orientations, one ledger each"
  (`HasBothOrientations`, carrying separate credit and debit potentials
  `K⁺` and `K⁻`) is a genuinely weaker datum than a single two-sided account;
* Part C (the common Bellman bridge and the exact cycle criterion):
  the scalar bridge `c = D B` is an *equality*, so its feasibility is
  governed by the cycle space with both signs, not by the one-sided cone.

**Scope, honestly.**  Only the orientation/bridge gates of the strategic
account-completeness invariant `SAC` are treated here.  The
other two clauses — *finite public observability* (Part A) and *shift
compactness or bounded restart* (Part D) — are **future work** and are not
formalized in this file, nor is any statement below strong enough to imply
them.

**This file is deliberately game-free**, exactly like its substrate: rows `R`
and vertices `V` are bare finite types and `P` is a bare row-stochastic
matrix.  The strategic reading belongs to the consumers.

## Main definitions

* `IsExactBridge src P c H`: the *equality* version of
  `OwnerLabeledFlowHolonomy.IsAccountPotential`, i.e. `c` is an exact
  coboundary, `c r = H (src r) - ∑ v, P r v * H v` for every row.
* `NeutralHolonomy src P c`: every circulation pairs to exactly `0` with `c`
  (the two-sided cycle criterion for the scalar bridge).
* `HasBothOrientations src P c`: Part B — one ledger per orientation, with
  the two potentials allowed to differ.
* `HasFullSupportCirculation src P`: the irreducibility-flavoured hypothesis
  that some circulation charges every row strictly positively.

## Main results

* `neutralHolonomy_iff_zeroHolonomy_pair`: the two-sided cycle criterion is
  exactly zero holonomy for `c` together with zero holonomy for `-c`.
* `hasBothOrientations_iff_zeroHolonomy_pair`: unconditionally, carrying one
  ledger per orientation is exactly the two-sided cycle criterion (two
  applications of the substrate's Farkas duality).
* `exists_isExactBridge_iff_zeroHolonomy_pair`: **under**
  `HasFullSupportCirculation`, an exact bridge exists iff the two-sided cycle
  criterion holds; equivalently (`exists_isExactBridge_iff_hasBothOrientations`)
  iff both orientations carry a ledger.  The forward direction is
  unconditional; the converse genuinely needs the hypothesis.
* `ParallelRows.not_exists_isExactBridge_charge`: the hypothesis is not
  decorative.  Two parallel rows leaving a source vertex that is never
  re-entered admit *no* nonzero circulation at all, so the cycle criterion is
  vacuously true and both orientations carry ledgers, yet no exact bridge
  exists.  So `HasBothOrientations` does **not** imply an exact bridge in
  general.
* `SelfLoop.not_hasBothOrientations` and
  `SelfLoop.not_exists_isExactBridge`: the
  *pure common-orientation obstruction*.  On the one-state self-loop with a
  strictly negative charge the credit ledger exists (`H = 0` works) while the
  debit ledger does not: the unique normalized circulation is the Farkas
  witness `φ(e) = 1`.  Here `HasFullSupportCirculation` *holds*, so
  the failure is one of orientation only.

/-! ### The parallel-rows separation

Two rows leaving the same source vertex `false` and both landing
deterministically on `true`.  Nothing ever returns, so the *only* circulation
is `0`: the cycle criterion is vacuously satisfied by every charge cochain and
every charge carries both orientations.  Yet an exact bridge would force the
two rows to carry the *same* charge, since both drifts equal
`H false - H true`.  This separates `HasBothOrientations` from
`IsExactBridge`, and shows the full-support hypothesis in
`exists_isExactBridge_iff_zeroHolonomy_pair` is necessary. -/

/-! ### The one-state orientation falsifier

The *pure common-orientation obstruction*.
One public mode, one row, a self-loop, and a strictly negative charge `a`.

The unique normalized circulation is the constant `1`; it pairs to `a` with
the charge.  So the credit ledger exists — `H = 0` discharges `a ≤ 0` — while
the debit ledger for `-a > 0` cannot exist: the self-loop circulation is the
Farkas witness `φ(e) = 1`.  Here the *full-support* hypothesis
`hasFullSupportCirculation` **holds**, so this is not a connectivity failure:
it is a pure orientation failure that a full-support hypothesis alone cannot
rule out. -/
