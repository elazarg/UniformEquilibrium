# The owner-obstruction cokernel

**Provenance.**  This file glues the two "Layer A" routing interfaces
`Math.LinearAlgebra.OwnerTypedDualLifting` (owner-typed dual
lifting, custody) and `Math.LinearAlgebra.OwnerLabeledFlowHolonomy`
(account potentials, circulations, holonomy) into a single
finite-dimensional invariant: the quotient of the target-normal space by
everything a *single owner* can certify, either through its own unilateral
Bellman rows or through a global scalar account potential.

**This file is deliberately game-free.**  Everything below is finite linear
algebra over `ℝ`.  `Ω` is a bare owner-label type, `E`, `N`, `U` are bare
finite row index types, `Y`, `T` bare finite column index types, `V` a bare
finite vertex type, and `src`/`trans` a bare source map and a bare weight
matrix.  No games, strategies, payoffs, probability measures or dynamics
occur.

## The mandatory caveat: a nonzero class is algebra, not strategy

A nonzero obstruction class is a statement about **linear algebra only**: it
says that a target normal is not the sum of an owner-`i`-typed signed
multiplier combination and an account coboundary.  It is **not**, by itself,
a strategic obstruction.  The surrounding project contains a machine-checked
pure-externality example in which strictly positive holonomy coexists with a
genuine uniform equilibrium; positive holonomy — and a fortiori a nonzero
class, which is weaker in one direction and stronger in another — therefore
does **not** entail that any strategic construction fails.  The cokernel
*classifies gluing failure of certificates*.  Consuming a nonzero class as a
statement about players, strategies or equilibria requires a separate,
separately proved theorem, and none is offered here.  (No game file is
imported, on purpose.)

## Main definitions

* `rowLoad`: the multiplier-weighted combination of the three row blocks of a
  typed cell, with the unilateral multipliers pre-multiplied by a mask.  The
  mask replaces the support condition `IsTypedLift.owner_pure`.
* `signedNormals P m`: the submodule of target normals reachable by *signed*
  `m`-masked multipliers whose internal coefficients cancel.  This is the
  linearization of `OwnerTypedDualLifting.HasTypedLift` (signs and the bound
  `β` dropped, so that the object is a subspace and not merely a cone).
* `IsDualDirection P m lam x`: the dual test data — the lineality-space form
  of `OwnerTypedDualLifting.IsVisibleRecession`.
* `OwnerSystem`: a typed cell together with a finite flow structure
  `src : T → V`, `trans : T → V → ℝ` on the boundary target index.  The
  target coordinates double as the rows of the flow system, so a target
  normal is simultaneously a charge cochain in the sense of
  `OwnerLabeledFlowHolonomy`.
* `accountCell`: the typed cell obtained by appending the account block, i.e.
  the columns `incidenceEntry src trans` of the incidence matrix, to the
  structural equations.  Account potentials become free multipliers.
* `ownerNormals sys i` and `globalNormals sys`: what owner `i` alone, resp.
  all owners together, can certify.
* `Obstruction sys i := (T → ℝ) ⧸ ownerNormals sys i` and
  `obstructionClass`: the cokernel and the class map.
* `IsObstructionTest sys i lam x`: the dual test vectors — signed
  circulations of the flow system that additionally lie in the lineality
  space of owner `i`'s visible relaxation.

## Main results

* `mem_signedNormals_iff`: **the Farkas duality.**  A target normal is a
  signed masked lift **iff** it annihilates every dual direction.  Proved
  with the in-tree `Math.LinearAlgebra.theorem_of_alternative` (the
  infeasibility ⇔ certificate form; the objective-bound
  `farkas_lemma_fintype` is unusable here because it presupposes primal
  feasibility, which is exactly what is in question).
* `mem_ownerNormals_iff`: the primal, gluing form — `α` is certifiable by
  owner `i` exactly when it decomposes as an owner-`i`-pure signed Bellman
  combination plus a scalar account coboundary.
* `obstructionClass_eq_zero_iff_forall_test`: the class of `α` vanishes iff
  the ownerwise witnesses glue iff every obstruction test pairs to `0`.
* `obstruction_alternative` / `not_and_of_obstruction_alternative`: the
  computability statement.  Either the decomposition exists, or an explicit
  separating signed circulation certifies the nonzero class; never both.
* `mem_ownerNormals_of_hasTypedLift` /
  `not_hasTypedLift_of_obstructionClass_ne_zero`: the lifting presentation.
  A nonzero class kills every `OwnerTypedDualLifting.HasTypedLift` at every
  bound (the converse is false — a typed lift also needs signs and a bound).
* `finrank_obstruction_add_finrank`: the object is finite dimensional, of
  corank the dimension of the certifiable subspace.
* `ownerNormals_eq_globalNormals_of_subsingleton`,
  `obstructionClass_eq_zero_of_subsingleton` and
  `subsingleton_obstruction_of_subsingleton`: the required sanity theorem.
  With a single owner, ownerwise = global, so every globally certifiable
  normal has zero class, and the cokernel is literally the zero space as soon
  as every normal is certifiable.  Honest scope: the ambient is *all* target
  normals, so a single-owner cokernel need not vanish outright — see
  `ParallelRowsCounterexample`, where it does not.
* `TrivialSystem.ownerNormals_eq_bot`: the zero-system vacuity probe.  On the
  zero system the certifiable subspace is `⊥`, so the class map is injective
  and nothing below is vacuously true.
* `obstructionClass_eq_zero_iff_exists_isExactBridge`: with no typed rows the
  object is exactly the coboundary cokernel — a class vanishes iff the charge
  cochain is an exact account bridge in the sense of `OrientedAccountBridge`.
* `zeroHolonomy_of_obstructionClass_eq_zero`: **one direction of the duality
  with `ZeroHolonomy`**, under the hypothesis that every circulation extends
  to an obstruction test (automatic when the typed blocks are absent).
* `ParallelRowsCounterexample`: **the converse fails.**  On the parallel-rows
  system of `OrientedAccountBridge` every circulation is zero — so
  `ZeroHolonomy` holds for every charge — yet the class of `charge` is
  nonzero, separated by the *signed* cycle `(1, -1)`.  The obstruction space
  sees the whole signed cycle space; `ZeroHolonomy` sees only its
  nonnegative cone.
* `TwoCycleObstruction.obstructionClass_ne_zero` and
  `CrossOwnerObstruction.obstructionClass_ne_zero`: the two mandatory
  falsifiers recomputed as class computations, each exhibited by an explicit
  nonnegative circulation.

/-! ### The Farkas duality

The decomposition question "is `α` a signed `m`-masked lift?" is a finite
system of linear *equations* in free multipliers.  Written as two weak
inequalities per equation it becomes the normal form `A z ≥ b` consumed by
`Math.LinearAlgebra.theorem_of_alternative`, whose Farkas certificate is
literally a dual direction pairing positively with `α`.  Note that the
objective-bound form `Math.LinearAlgebra.farkas_lemma_fintype` cannot be used
here: it presupposes primal feasibility, which is exactly the question. -/

/-! ### The converse of the `ZeroHolonomy` comparison fails

The parallel-rows system of `OrientedAccountBridge`: two rows leaving the
same vertex, nothing ever returning.  The *only* circulation is `0`, so
`ZeroHolonomy` holds for every charge; but the signed cycle space is a line,
and the charge cochain pairs nontrivially with it, so its class is nonzero.
The obstruction cokernel is dual to the whole *signed* cycle space, while
`ZeroHolonomy` only tests the nonnegative cone.  There is a single owner
here, so this is not an owner-splitting failure. -/
