# Analytic coefficient lifts on a fixed simplicial cone

A linearly independent finite generator family has a global linear left
inverse: apply a left inverse to its finite linear-combination map.  In a
finite-dimensional real normed space this coordinate map is continuous, so
its coefficients along an analytic curve are analytic.

Consequently, once a curve is known to remain in one fixed simplicial cone
on a punctured right neighborhood, it has a simultaneous analytic,
nonnegative coefficient lift on that same neighborhood.

Selecting the fixed support from an arbitrary finite cone is a separate
semialgebraic support-freezing step.  No such selection principle is assumed
or hidden here.
