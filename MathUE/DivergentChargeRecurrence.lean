# Compact recurrence across a divergent charge block

Compact recurrence by itself need not produce a return small relative to a
vanishing one-step charge.  The correct denominator for a cyclic affine
closing argument is instead the charge accumulated over the whole returned
segment.

This file proves the game-free selection principle.  If a sequence remains in
a compact metric set and a nonnegative charge has divergent partial sums, then
for every metric tolerance and every prescribed charge budget there are two
ordered visits which are close while the charge accumulated between them is at
least that budget.

The second part records the elementary survival estimate

`prod (1 - q_k) * (1 + sum q_k) <= 1`.

Consequently a segment with raw charge at least one has aggregate absorption
`1 - prod (1 - q_k)` at least one half.  This is the fixed denominator needed
to close an exact affine/Bellman orbit with one small endpoint seam.

/-- **Compact return with an arbitrarily large prefix-clock gap.**

A sequence in a compact metric set has a convergent subsequence.  Composing an
unbounded prefix clock with the strictly increasing subsequence leaves it
unbounded, so two sufficiently late visits are simultaneously close and
separated by any prescribed clock gap. -/
