# Finite controlled stopping envelopes

This file isolates the finite Bellman construction needed when a public
selection phase is not action-independent.  A finite ranked transition
system has one prescribed kernel and, for each player and pure action, one
unilateral controlled kernel.  The prescribed kernel is the mixture of the
controlled kernels under the prescribed mixed action.

For a terminal obstacle, backward induction constructs two values:

* the prescribed stopping value;
* the worst unilateral stopping envelope.

The envelope is superharmonic for every pure action and hence for every
mixed unilateral action.  It dominates the prescribed value.  If the
domination is strict at a root, a descent through the prescribed support
finds a prescribed-reachable node and a player-owned action with a strictly
positive Bellman gap.  Thus a large root gap cannot be caused only by an
unreachable branch of the finite tree.

The obstacle may depend on the complete finite public history encoded by
`Node`.  In a stopped-child application it should be the selected child's
initial target or deviation potential at that terminal history.  No
globally absorbing implementation is assumed here.

/-- Finite ranked stopping data for one prescribed process and every pure
unilateral one-step replacement.

The rank condition is imposed on both the prescribed kernel and every
controlled kernel.  It is the finite-tree condition that makes backward
induction exact.  `prescribed_eq_mix` records the ordinary behavioral fact
that prescribed play is the mixture of its pure unilateral replacements. -/
