# Finite discounted product-flow kinematics

This file packages the exact product-flow equations used by finite stochastic
games without adding payoff or equilibrium data.  State occupation and every
mixed action are represented by PMFs.  The joint-action mass is therefore the
state mass times the independent product of the action marginals.

Balanced product-flow data compile to the labelled discounted-flow API.  The
generic state, cut, and successor-bundle identities can then be reused without
reproving their finite-sum algebra.

This is a kinematic interface only: it contains no converse realization or
strategic-sufficiency assertion.
