# Moving endpoint transport: occupation evidence and the exact alternative

For a sequence of state laws and a fixed real target, cumulative endpoint
transport either is asymptotically sublinear, or some fixed state is occupied
at non-sublinear rate with strictly positive displacement in one fixed
orientation.  `OrientedOccupation` packages the second leaf, and
`Alternative` states the exact dichotomy.

This is a statement about `PMF` state laws only: no game, player, strategy or
Bellman datum enters it.  The prescribed analytic calendar that supplies such
a law lives with the stochastic-game development.
