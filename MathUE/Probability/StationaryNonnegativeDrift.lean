# Nonnegative drift under a stationary finite-state weight

For a finite Markov kernel, stationarity makes the weighted sum of every
potential drift vanish. If the weight and all drifts are nonnegative, the
drift therefore vanishes at each state carrying positive weight.

This elementary observation gives harmonicity on any closed communicating
class on which a stationary weight has full support. The existing finite
maximum principle then makes the potential constant on that class. All
statements use explicit stationarity, positivity, closure, and communication
hypotheses; no recurrence assumption is inferred from terminology.
