# Weighted reset ledgers

A family of local drift accounts may allow one account to increase when
another account pays a reset charge. Such inequalities are sound only when
the reset dependencies admit positive scalarization weights.

This file proves the finite-horizon algebra behind that scalarization. The
coercivity hypothesis is exactly the weighted small-gain condition. Strictly
triangular reset dependencies admit such weights by backward substitution;
cyclic systems require the same condition as an additional hypothesis.

/-- Strictly triangular nonnegative reset dependencies admit positive
scalarization weights with any prescribed positive residual coefficient.

The order on `Fin accountCount` is the priority order: a reset of `account`
may be paid only by a strictly higher-priority `payer < account`. The proof
is backward substitution from the lowest-priority account. -/
