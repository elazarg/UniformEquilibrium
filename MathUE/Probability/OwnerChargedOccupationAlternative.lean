# Owner-preserving charged occupation alternatives

This file assembles the finite charged-occupation alternative independently
for every owner. The circulation branch never cancels transitions belonging
to different owners. In the potential branch, the scalar potentials are
assembled into one owner-indexed vector potential.

/-- Either one owner has a normalized positive charged circulation using only
that owner's transition family, or one owner-indexed potential controls every
transition in every family.

This is an exact exclusive alternative. It does not assert that an owner can
force entry into the support of the circulation. -/
