# Communicating classes under a full-support invariant law

A finite Markov kernel admitting a stationary law with strictly positive
mass at every state has no transient states.  Equivalently, every support
edge can be followed by a support path back to its source.  Consequently,
the mutual-reachability class of any state is closed.

The results here isolate the finite Markov-chain fact needed to decompose a
positive occupation circulation into closed communicating classes.
