# Optimal pure policies for finite controlled stopping models

The finite controlled stopping envelope is attained, not merely an upper
bound.  Choosing at every nonterminal node a pure action maximizing the
continuation envelope gives a node-dependent pure policy whose controlled
stopping value equals the worst-case potential, by backward induction.
