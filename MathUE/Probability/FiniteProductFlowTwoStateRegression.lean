# The two-state product-flow regression

This file formalizes the exact two-state Stay/Go calculation that separates
first active positive cut balance from later signed residual balance.

At state `u`, Go has probability `ε²`, Stay loops at `u`, and Go moves to an
absorbing state `v`.  The initial law gives each state mass `1/2`.  The exact
discounted stock at `u` and the rare `u → v` flux are

`d(ε) = 1 / (2 * (1 + ε - ε²))`,

`F(ε) = (1 - ε) * d(ε) * ε²`.

The cut equation is `ε d + F = ε / 2`.  After subtracting its first-order
part and dividing by `ε²`, the reset-stock residual is strictly negative and
the rare outgoing flux is strictly positive; the two terms cancel exactly.
Thus the second-scale equation is signed, not a new positive balance law.
