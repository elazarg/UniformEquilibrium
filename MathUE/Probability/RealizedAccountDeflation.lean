# Realized-account deflation

Membership of a charge direction in a processed linear span is qualitative.
It does not by itself pay repeated occurrences of that direction.  The
additional datum needed for an accounting deflation is a realized account:
the processed charge at each stage is the increment of an account whose
endpoint motion is controlled.

This file states that interface, proves its telescoping bound, and gives the
minimal one-dimensional boundary.  The constant charge `1` lies in the full
processed span at every stage, but no bounded account realizes it.  Thus span
membership alone cannot close an already-processed branch of a recursive
response construction.
