# Finite-owner analytic charged occupation flows

For each member of a finite owner set, consider a finite analytic family of
occupation columns and charges. Applying the analytic charged-flow
alternative owner by owner yields either a positive charged circulation for
one owner or a scaled charged-occupation potential for every owner.

The potential branch below synchronizes the individual clearing powers. It
uses the largest pole order and multiplies each lower-order potential by the
missing nonnegative power of the parameter. Thus the result has one common
pole order while retaining a separate analytic potential for each owner.

/-- **Finite-owner analytic charged-flow alternative.**

Either one owner has a pole-cleared analytic positive charged circulation,
or all owners carry analytic scaled charged-occupation potentials with one
common pole-clearing order. The theorem only combines finite-dimensional
flow certificates; it assigns no strategic meaning to the owner index. -/
