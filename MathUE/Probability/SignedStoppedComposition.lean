# Signed stopped composition

The elementary calculus of the stopped expectation for a
`ControlledTransport`, the composition of a signed selection phase with
child deliveries, the transport input bundle, and the boundary charge.

Everything here is stated for abstract state, history and index types: no
game, profile or Bellman datum appears.  The parent certificate that
consumes this layer lives with the stochastic-game development.

`TwoChildFence` is the separating witness: a fair public coin between a `+1`
child and a `-1` child satisfies the signed hypotheses with zero selection
error while the branchwise strengthening fails by a full unit at each
positive-probability branch.

/-! ## The two-child fence

A fair public coin selects between a `+1` child and a `-1` child.  The parent
target is `0`.  The signed hypotheses (H1) and (H2) hold with
`selectionError = 0`; the branchwise strengthening fails by a full unit at
each of the two positive-probability branches, and its accumulated bill is
exactly the horizon.  The composition theorem of this file applies.

The underlying process is `Math.Probability.TwoBranchProbe`, the minimal
witness (a root plus a two-point branch; two states provably cannot exhibit
the phenomenon). -/

/-- **The branchwise strengthening fails.**  The high leaf is a stopped

the leaf offsets from the parent target and the two fair weights are the

this process rather than a detached arithmetic illustration. -/
