# Harmonic values on finite closed communicating classes

The finite maximum principle says that a real-valued function harmonic for
a Markov kernel is constant on every finite closed communicating class.
Applying the scalar statement coordinatewise transports an entire finite or
infinite payoff vector; no positivity of an occupation charge is involved.
