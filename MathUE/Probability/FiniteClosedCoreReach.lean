# Finite closed-core reachability and transient occupation

For a finite Markov kernel, suppose a set `core` is support-closed and every
state has a positive-probability support path to some (source-dependent)
state of `core`.  Finiteness upgrades those paths to one common horizon and
one positive lower bound on the probability of having entered `core`.

The hitting-time potential API then gives an exact Poisson equation for the
off-core indicator.  Consequently total expected off-core occupation is
uniformly bounded, and the indicator has zero harmonic component in every
mean-ergodic Poisson decomposition.
