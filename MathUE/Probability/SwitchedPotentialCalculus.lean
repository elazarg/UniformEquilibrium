# The switching-coboundary calculus for predictable potentials

A potential account for a *time-varying* environment must let the potential
move with the environment.  This file is the single integration-by-parts layer
for that situation: a predictable potential path `H : ℕ → S → ℝ` is paired with
per-stage kernels `Q t` and per-stage costs `f t`, and the one-step **slack**

```
switchedLocalSlack (Q t) (f t) (H t) (H (t + 1)) s
  = f t s + (Q t H (t + 1)) s - H t s
```

is the exact coboundary defect.  Summing the slack telescopes: the potential
path contributes only its two endpoints, and everything else is a *charge*.

The design is deliberately **mode/phase-lifted** rather than state-only, for
two independent reasons made precise by the falsifier probes at the end of
this file.  First, `AlternatingHarvest` exhibits two modes that are each
individually harmless — each admits its own bias inequality — yet share no
common state-only potential, so the per-switch charge is genuinely
unavoidable and cannot be absorbed into a single account.  Second,
`PhaseHarvest` exhibits a periodic schedule whose *phase*-indexed potentials
are exactly slack-free, while every choice of *mode*-indexed potentials still
pays a strictly positive oscillation charge per cycle: mode-indexed
accounting is a strictly weaker instrument than phase-indexed accounting,
because path-complete accounts are coboundaries on the lifted `(mode, state)`
graph but need not be coboundaries on the base `state` graph alone.

## Layers

1. `stageSlack` and `sum_expect_stageSlack_eq` — the exact telescoping identity
   along a marginal law path, together with its one-sided forms.
2. `controlledKernel` / `controlledCost` — the control layer: a pointwise
   `(state, action)` inequality survives every randomized state-feedback policy,
   which is how the "supremum over policies" strength is obtained.
3. Switching charges in three payment modes, each a separate theorem:
   * `sum_expect_scheduledCost_le_switchingBill` — span-normalized pairwise
     oscillation bills, giving the `C (1 + J)` shape;
   * `sum_expect_scheduledCost_le_directedCharges` — the transition-aware
     directed cost `Γᵢⱼ`, with `directedCharge_le_oscillationCharge` proving
     `Γᵢⱼ ≤ Δᵢⱼ`;
   * `sum_expect_cost_le_resetBudget` — total-variation / reset budgets.
4. `sum_expect_phaseCost_le` — the phase-lifted exactness layer for a periodic
   mode word: per-phase slack `≤ g` gives the uniform-in-shifts windowed
   bound `g * N + 2 * bound`.
5. Falsifier probes `AlternatingHarvest` and `PhaseHarvest`.

Every cap here is conditioned on `IsMarginalLawPath`, which
`isMarginalLawPath_marginalLawPath` shows is always satisfiable, so none of the
statements is vacuous; the two probes additionally exhibit explicit witnesses.

## What is *not* formalized

Only the sufficiency direction of the phase-lifted windowed bound is proved:
per-phase slack `≤ g` gives the cap.  The converse — that the best-possible
`g` equals a maximum over the phase occupation polytope — is a finite
average-reward LP duality statement on the phase-augmented chain; the repo has
no average-reward LP duality (`Math.LinearAlgebra.FourierMotzkin` is raw
elimination, not a Farkas certificate for occupation measures), so that
direction is left open.  Likewise the Farkas equivalence between per-mode
harmlessness and nonemptiness of the bias polyhedron is assumed rather than
derived: `IsModeBias` is taken as the primitive input.

## Relation to existing in-tree accounts

This layer is designed to *subsume* — but does not modify — the following
existing instances, each of which is a special case of one row above:

* `Math.Probability.AdaptiveTransitionAccount`: its fixed-potential identity
  `selectedTransitionCenteredScore_add_drift_eq_accountIncrement` is the
  constant-potential case `H t = H`, and its exceptional-transition machinery
  (`exceptionalTransitionCost_isAsymptoticallySublinear`) is a reset-budget
  charge supported on a sublinearly used index set.
* `Math.Probability.SupportedMovingKernelEpochAccount`: its epoch-selected
  potentials (`expected_epochCost_le_supportedBill_of_expectedDrift`) are the
  piecewise-constant predictable potential path `H t = potential (epoch t)`,
  whose charge is exactly the epoch-boundary oscillation bill.
* `UniformEquilibrium.VanishingDiscount.Fink.Limit`'s
  time-dependent state-potential telescopes are the uncontrolled (`A = Unit`) special case of
  `sum_expect_stageSlack_eq`.

Actually rewriting those three files on top of this one is future work; nothing
here depends on them and nothing there is changed.

oscillation accounting

The `(u, v, v)` schedule admits phase potentials with
per-phase slack `g = 0`, hence a horizon-free cap; but every pair of per-mode
biases pays at least one unit of oscillation per `u ↔ v` cycle, i.e. at least
`1 / 3` per stage. -/
