# Optional target transport under unilateral control

This file is the kernel of a composition engine.  It supplies two
independent, deliberately elementary pieces.

## Part 1: vector-valued optional target transport

A `ControlledTransport` records a finite state space, a history type with a
one-step extension, a causal stopping predicate and, for one designated
deviating coordinate, a set of allowed replacement transition laws.  A
*unilateral control* picks, at every history, either the prescribed law or an
allowed deviation.  All values are evaluated at the history stopped either by
the causal predicate or by a finite horizon, so every stopping time occurring
below is bounded.

Three statements are proved, in the history-potential form and then in the
state-vector form:

* exact transport - a coordinatewise harmonic vector value is delivered
  *in expectation* at the stopped history;
* a unilateral cap - a coordinate superharmonic under the prescribed law and
  under every allowed deviation cannot be increased by any unilateral
  control;
* approximate versions with a nonnegative per-step error, whose penalty is
  the expected accumulated error `E[∑_{t < τ} e t]`.

Every conclusion is **signed and one-sided**.  The approximate transport is
recorded as two separate signed inequalities rather than one absolute-value
bound, and no statement is branchwise: the point of the theorem is exactly
that expected target delivery does *not* require pathwise preservation of
the target.  `TwoBranchProbe` below documents this with an explicit chain
whose value is harmonic at the root while the two positive-probability
successors carry different values.

A minimality fact worth recording, and proved here as
`harmonic_two_state_constant_or_absorbing`: no two-state example can exhibit
the phenomenon.  On a two-point state space, harmonicity of `V` at a state
forces either `V` constant or an absorbing transition there, so `V` is
preserved pathwise.  The probe therefore uses a root plus a two-point branch,
the smallest possible witness.

## Part 2: occupation concentration

If a nonnegative residual `slack t` is at least the margin `δ` whenever the
process occupies a region at time `t`, then the expected occupation count
before `T` is at most `(∑_{t < T} E[slack t]) / δ`.  A sublinear cumulative
slack budget therefore forces sublinear expected occupation.  A moving-margin
version replaces `δ` by `δ t`.  No adaptedness or Markov property is used:
the estimate is pure linearity plus a pointwise comparison, which is why it
is stated once here instead of being re-derived at each use site.

/-- Data for a time-indexed process under unilateral control.

`extend` appends a sampled state to the finite history and `current` reads
the last state, so `History` may encode the entire past.  `stop` is the
causal stopping rule: it is decided by the history observed so far.
`prescribed` is the equilibrium transition law and `allowed` is the set of
replacement laws available to the single designated deviating coordinate. -/

/-! ### Falsifier probes

Both probes live on the smallest state space that can carry the phenomenon:
a root together with a two-point branch. -/

/-- Two states are not enough.  If a value is harmonic at one of two states
then either the value is constant or the transition there is absorbing, so in
both cases the target is preserved pathwise.  This is why the probe below
needs a root together with a two-point branch: three states is the minimum. -/

/-! ### Bridge to the finite controlled stopping envelope

The rank-indexed potentials of `FiniteControlledStoppingEnvelope` are exactly
the harmonic and superharmonic inputs required above.  Instantiating the
transport theorems at that model shows the two files compose without any new
process definition: the envelope's `Node` doubles as both the state and the
history, its `terminal` predicate is the causal stopping rule, and its mixed
unilateral replacements are the allowed deviations. -/
