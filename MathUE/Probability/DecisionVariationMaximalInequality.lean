# A weak-L² maximal inequality for adaptive decision processes

Here `Ω` is one *decision step's* observation: the action chosen at the current state
together with the next state. The kernel `step n history` is the law of that observation
given the past, so the filtration carried by `adaptiveHistoryLaw step` is exactly
"everything known immediately before the `n`-th decision", and a predictable score
`score n history ω` is the decision increment `D_n = v(Y_n) - v(X_n)` of that step.

Two hypotheses drive the whole file:

* `hcenter` is the half-step martingale property `E[D_n | F_n] = 0`;
* `hbalanced` is δ-balancedness `|D_n| ≤ δ`.

Writing `S_T = ∑_{k < T} D_k` for the cumulative score and `w̄_T = ∑_{k < T} |D_k|` for the
pathwise decision variation, the results are:

* `expect_predictableScoreSum_eq_sum_expect_conditionalMean` — the compensator identity
  `E[S_T] = ∑_{k < T} E[E[D_k | F_k]]`, with no centering hypothesis;
* `expectedDecisionVariation` — the expected decision variation `E[w̄_T]`, monotone in `T`
  and nonnegative;
* `expect_predictableScoreSum_sq_eq_sum` — orthogonality of centered increments,
  `E[S_T²] = ∑_{k < T} E[E[D_k² | F_k]]`;
* `sq_mul_expect_indicator_le_mul_expectedDecisionVariation` — the maximal inequality
  `ε² · P(max_{m ≤ T} |S_m| ≥ ε) ≤ δ · E[w̄_T]`, and its uniform-in-`T` corollary
  `expect_indicator_le_div_of_expectedDecisionVariation_le`;
* `expect_indicator_scoreRunningMax_le_div` — the one-sided strengthening
  `P(max_{m ≤ T} S_m ≥ ε) ≤ V / (ε² + V)` for `V = δ · E[w̄_T]`.

The infinite-horizon form `P(sup_m |S_m| ≥ ε) ≤ δ · E[w̄] / ε²` follows from the
uniform-in-`T` corollary by continuity from below. It is *not* formalized here, because the
infinite path measure is not constructed in this repository.

The observation alphabet is assumed finite (`[Finite Ω]`), which is a restriction relative to
the countable-alphabet statement of the result. Every integrand appearing below is bounded, so
the countable case would go through `expect_bind_of_bounded` and `expect_add_of_summable` in
place of `expect_bind` and `expect_add`; that generalization is not carried out here.

`(ε + a)² P ≤ V + a²`, `a ≥ 0`, is strongest at `a = V / ε`, where it gives
`P ≤ V / (ε² + V)`. The degenerate case `V = 0` is covered by the shift `a = 0`. -/
