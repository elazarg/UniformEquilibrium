# Exact alternative for bounded realized accounts

A processed direction can be discharged by a bounded account exactly when
its realized cumulative charge is bounded.  The canonical account is the
partial-sum process itself.  If those partial sums are not bounded, every
account realizing the charge is necessarily unbounded.

This is the sharp extra hypothesis missing from qualitative processed-span
membership.  The file also records closure under finite linear combinations:
processed basis directions can be combined only when their charge
decomposition is realized by the same coefficients.
