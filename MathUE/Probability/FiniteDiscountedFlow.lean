# Exact finite discounted-flow accounting

This file isolates the finite algebra behind discounted occupation flows.
An aggregate flow has a stock at each state, a reset source, and a directed
flux.  Its two defining equations are state balance and the fact that a
fraction `1 - reset` of every stock leaves its source.  Summing those equations
over a set of states gives the exact cut identity.

The labelled version records a finite family of stochastic transition rows at
each source.  It supplies the fixed-kernel successor identities and compiles
to the aggregate flow.  No positivity, asymptotic, or strategic hypothesis is
needed for these identities.
