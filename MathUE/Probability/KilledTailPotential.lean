# Scalar potentials for killed time-inhomogeneous tails

This file isolates the finite algebra behind a scalar potential transported
through a time-inhomogeneous survival process.  If

```
potential t = source t + seam t + survival t * potential (t + 1),
```

then every finite fold has three terms:

* the killed sum of `source`;
* the killed sum of `seam`;
* the surviving terminal boundary value.

The boundary term is retained explicitly.  In particular, finite seam
summability does not by itself remove a positive harmonic or "phantom"
boundary at infinity.

For an excessive potential, the canonical seam is its one-step
`killedDissipation`.  The final results state the additional boundary
hypothesis needed to force that seam to vanish: the surviving boundary must
already exhaust the part of the initial potential not used by the source.
Equivalently, against an exact reference account with the same source and
initial value, the excessive account's boundary must dominate the reference
boundary.  Without such a boundary comparison, strict dissipation is fully
compatible with finite killed-source accounting.

All statements are deterministic real algebra.  They do not construct a
stochastic process, identify a game-theoretic packet with an occupation law,
or justify a boundary comparison between two independently constructed
accounts.
