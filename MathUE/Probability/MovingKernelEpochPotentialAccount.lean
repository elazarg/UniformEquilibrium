# Potential accounts for a piecewise-frozen moving kernel

This file factors the marginal-law core of punctured-potential calendar
accounting.  A state law follows one kernel throughout each quadratic epoch.
If an epoch cost is bounded pointwise by the drift of one epoch potential,
then its cumulative expected cost is bounded by one endpoint bill per
completed epoch and one bill for the current epoch.

No game, behavior strategy, recurrence class, or payoff target occurs here.
