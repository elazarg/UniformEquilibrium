# Charged occupation-flow alternative

For a finite family of source-consuming transition columns, attach one real
charge to every available transition. Exactly one of the following holds:

* nonnegative transition masses balance and have normalized total charge one;
* a state potential dominates the charge of every transition.

This is the exact finite Farkas alternative needed before a stochastic flow
can be used as a positive incentive certificate. It does not single out one
edge and it does not reverse an unavailable transition.
