# Pole-cleared stationary laws for analytic finite kernels

Stationarity of a finite Markov kernel is a homogeneous nonnegative linear
system, with the total mass fixed to one.  This file applies the analytic
normalized-Farkas selector to that system.

The result is deliberately local and finite-dimensional.  If normalized
stationary weights exist throughout a punctured right neighborhood, then one
fixed Cramer support selects them meromorphically: multiplication by one
power of the parameter gives an analytic nonnegative vector.  If the
normalized stationary weight is unique, this selected quotient is the
unique stationary law.

For a fixed punctured-support closed communicating class, existence and
uniqueness are the ordinary finite irreducible-chain facts.  They remain
explicit hypotheses here so that the theorem does not silently identify a
closed class, a legal game continuation, or an externally reachable child.
