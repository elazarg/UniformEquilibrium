# Tail-reachable support of analytic kernel coordinates

An analytic Bellman curve is a stochastic kernel only on its valid positive
parameter interval.  Its analytic extension need not be PMF-valued away
from that interval.  Accordingly, this file defines punctured support for
raw real coordinates, rather than assuming a globally PMF-valued analytic
kernel.

After the coordinate support stabilizes, the relevant state space need not
be the set reachable from the original game entry: a finite prefix may
already have moved the actual law elsewhere.  The correct fixed tail space
is the forward punctured-support closure of the support of the actual law at
the chosen tail start.

The main result says that an exact time-inhomogeneous `PMF.bind` recurrence
whose tail kernels use only stabilized coordinate edges has every later
marginal supported in this same fixed subtype.  No communicating-class,
stationary-law, charge, or game-theoretic claim is made.
