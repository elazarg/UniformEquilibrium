# Positive-charge classes of finite occupation circulations

A normalized charged circulation induces a stationary operational kernel on
its positive source support.  The communicating classes of that kernel
partition its stationary charge, whose total is one.  Hence one class has
strictly positive aggregate charge for the original charge function.

The returned entry is internal: it is a positive-mass source in the selected
class, and every state of the class is reachable from it under the induced
operational kernel.  No supplied external state is asserted to reach this
entry.  That stronger implication is false, as shown by
`PositiveCirculationNotReachable.circulation_and_closed_but_not_reachable`
and `ChargeLossCounterexample.unrestricted_positive_but_restricted_not`.
