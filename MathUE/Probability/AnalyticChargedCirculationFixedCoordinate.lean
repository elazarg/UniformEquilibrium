# A fixed charged coordinate of an analytic circulation

The exact moving charge identity of an analytic positive charged
circulation is already strong enough to select one fixed coordinate.  That
coordinate carries at least the average total charge on a punctured
neighborhood.  Since its mass is nonnegative, both its mass and its charge
are eventually strictly positive.

Continuity bounds the selected mass from above.  Dividing the average-share
bound by this fixed upper bound gives a power-law lower bound for the charge
itself, with the original pole-clearing order.

This conclusion remains valid in the stagnant order-zero lower branch.  It
is deliberately a moving-parameter coordinate witness, not an endpoint
circulation: one coordinate need not balance the occupation columns, and
its endpoint mass or endpoint charge may vanish.
