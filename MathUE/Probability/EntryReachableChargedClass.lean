# Positive communicating classes of entry-reachable occupations

An entry-reachable positive charged circulation induces a finite Markov
kernel on its positive source support.  Its normalized source mass is a
full-support invariant law, so every active state is recurrent and the
active kernel splits into closed communicating classes.

The total stationary charge is the sum of the charges of these classes.
Thus at least one class has positive aggregate charge.  This is stronger
than selecting a single positive transition: negative contributions in
the same class are included before the class is selected.
